<h2>Preface</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Having</span> vindicated in my introductory chapter
the practice of collecting book-plates from the
charge of flagrant immorality, I do not think it
necessary to spend many words in demonstrating
that it is in every way a worthy and reasonable
pursuit, and one which fully deserves to be made
the subject of a special treatise in a series of <i>Books
about Books</i>. If need were, the Editor of the series,
who asked me to write this little hand-book, would
perhaps kindly accept his share of responsibility,
but in the face of the existence of a flourishing 'Ex
Libris' Society, the importance of the book-plate
as an object of collection may almost be taken as
axiomatic. My own interest in this particular hobby
is of long standing, and happily the appearance, when
my manuscript was already at the printer's, of Mr.
Egerton Castle's pleasantly written and profusely
illustrated work on <i>English Book-Plates</i> has relieved
me of the dreaded necessity of writing an additional
chapter on those modern examples, in treating of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
which neither my knowledge nor my enthusiasm
would have equalled his.</div>

<p>The desire to possess a book-plate of one's own is
in itself commendable enough, for in fixing the first
copy into the first book the owner may surely be
assumed to have registered a vow that he or she at
least will not join the great army of book-persecutors&mdash;men
and women who cannot touch a volume
without maltreating it, and who, though they are
often ready to describe the removal of a book-plate,
even from a worthless volume, as an act of
vandalism, do infinitely more harm to books in
general by their ruthless handling of them. No
doubt, also, the decay of interest in heraldry, which
is mainly responsible for the eccentricities of modern
'fancy' examples, has taken from us the temptation
to commit certain sins which were at one time attractive.
Our ancestors, for instance, may sometimes
have outraged the susceptibilities of the heralds by
using as book-plates coats-of-arms to which they
had no title. Yet their offence against the College
of Arms was trivial when compared with the outrage
upon common-sense committed by the mystical
young man of to-day, who designs, or has designed
for him, an 'emblematic' book-plate, or a 'symbolic'
book-plate, or a 'theoretic' book-plate, in which the
emblem, or the symbol, or the theory, is far too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
mystical for any ordinary comprehension, and needs,
in fact, a lengthy explanation, which, however, I
am bound to confess, is always very willingly given
by either owner or designer, if asked for.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, needless to say that I am very far
from including all modern book-plates under this
condemnation. The names of the artists&mdash;Sir John
Millais, Mr. Stacy Marks, Randolph Caldecott, Mr.
Walter Crane, Miss Kate Greenaway, and others&mdash;who
have found time to design, some of them only
one, some quite a considerable number of really
interesting marks of ownership, suffice to rescue
modern book-plates from entire discredit. Here
and there, too, a little-known artist, like the late
Mr. Winter of Norwich, has produced a singularly
fine plate. Above all, the strikingly beautiful work
of Mr. Sherborn, as seen in the book-plates of the
Duke of Westminster, in that of Mr. William
Robinson, and in many other fine examples, forms
a refreshing oasis in the desert of wild eccentricity.
But the most ardent admirer of modern book-plates
cannot pretend that amid the multiplicity of recent
examples any school or style is observable, and as
I have aimed at giving in this little hand-book an
historic sketch, however unpretentious, of the different
styles adopted in designing book-plates from their
first introduction, I hope I may be excused for not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
having attempted to trace their history beyond the
early years of the present century, after which no
distinctive style can be said to exist.</p>

<p>As I have said elsewhere, it has been no part of
my object in writing my book to advocate indiscriminate
collecting. But for those who are
already collectors I have one word of advice on the
subject of the arrangement of their treasures. Some
enthusiasts advocate a chronological arrangement,
others a genealogical, others a topographical: and
the advocates of each theory paste down their
specimens in scrap-books or other volumes in adherence
to their own views. Now there is a great
deal to be said in favour of each of these classifications:
so much, indeed, that no system is perfect
which does not admit of a collection being arranged
according to one plan to-day and another tomorrow&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
no arrangement is satisfactory which
is necessarily permanent. Let each specimen be
lightly, yet firmly, fixed on a separate sheet of cardboard
or stout paper, of sufficient size to take the
largest book-plates commonly met with. These
cards or sheets may be kept, a hundred or a hundred
and fifty together, in portfolios or boxes, which should
be distinctly numbered. Each card or sheet should
also be paged and bear the number of the portfolio
to which it belongs. The collector can by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
means ascertain, when he pleases, if all his portfolios
contain their proper number of cards or sheets, and
he can arrange his specimens according to the
particular point of interest in his collection which
from time to time he may desire to illustrate. In
addition to this, the system of single cards has
obvious advantages for the purpose of minute study
and comparison.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it only remains for me to express
my warm thanks to Lord De Tabley and to Mr.
A. W. Franks, C.B.; to the former for allowing me
to make use, without oft-repeated acknowledgment,
of the matter contained in his <i>Guide to the Study of
Book-Plates</i>, a second, and much amplified edition
of which we may hope will, before long, make its
appearance; to the latter, not only for constant
advice and assistance, but also for the loan from
his collection of nearly all the book-plates with
reproductions of which this volume is illustrated.</p>

<h2>Preface to the Second Edition</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">A few</span> words are, perhaps, needed by way of introduction
to the present revised and enlarged edition
of this work. Some slips of my own have been
rectified, and there has been added a considerable
amount of additional information, brought to light
since 1893; for much of this I am indebted to the
researches of Mr. Egerton Castle, Mr. Charles Dexter
Allen, Miss Norna Labouchere, and Mr. Walter
Hamilton, as well as to Mr. Fincham and various
other contributors to the pages of the <i>Ex Libris
Journal</i>.</div>

<p>During the three years that have elapsed since
the first publication of my book, the ranks of those
taking an intelligent interest in book-plates have
been largely increased; yet they have suffered some
serious losses, and foremost amongst these must
be placed the death of Lord De Tabley. That he
died ere the completion of the promised new edition
of his <i>Guide to the Study of Book-Plates</i> is a matter
of sincere regret to every student of the subject;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
all we can now hope for is that Sir Wollaston Franks&mdash;the
one man really capable of bringing out a new
edition of Lord De Tabley's book&mdash;will some day
undertake the task.</p>

<p>As before, I have again to express my sincere
gratitude to a great number of collectors for the
kindly help they have given me; and I must not
pass without special thanks the kindness of Mr.
Everard Green, F.S.A., Rouge Dragon, for allowing
me to illustrate this preface with his own book-plate,
designed and engraved for him by Mr. George
W. Eve; it is in every way an excellent specimen of
modern work in book-plates, being both appropriate
and artistic, and, above all, rational.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>INTRODUCTORY</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Book-plate</span> collecting, at least in this country, is
a thing of yesterday. On the Continent, particularly
in France, it attracted attention sufficiently serious to
induce the publication, in 1874, of a monograph on
French book-plates by M. Poulet Malassis, which
in the next year obtained the honours of a second
edition. In England, prior to 1880, we had no work
devoted to the study; but, in that year, the Honourable
J. Leicester Warren&mdash;afterwards Lord De Tabley&mdash;published
<i>A Guide to the Study of Book-Plates (Ex
Libris)</i>. How little was then generally known about
these marks of ownership is shown by the allusions
to them&mdash;very few in number&mdash;that find place in the
pages of such publications as <i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>
or <i>Notes and Queries:</i> for that reason, the skilful
handling of the subject by the late Lord De Tabley,
and his zeal in compiling the treatise, are all the
more conspicuous.</div>

<p>One of the most useful works which has yet
appeared in the journal of the <i>Ex Libris</i> Society&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
society intended to promote the study of book-plates&mdash;is
a compilation by Mr. H. W. Fincham and Mr.
J. Roberts Brown, <i>A Bibliography of Book-Plates</i>,
arranged chronologically. A glance at this compilation
emphasises the truth of the statement, just made,
as to the scantiness of recorded information on book-plates
prior to the year 1880; it also shows what a
great deal about them has been written since.</p>

<p>Writing to <i>Notes and Queries</i> in 1877, Dr. Jackson
Howard, whose collection is now one of the largest
in England, says that he began collecting forty years
before that date, and that the nucleus of his own
collection was one made by a Miss Jenkins at Bath
in 1820. It is probably, therefore, to this lady that
we should attribute the honour of being the first
collector of book-plates, for their own sake. No doubt
the collector of engravings admitted into his portfolios
book-plates worthy a place there as interesting
engravings, for stray examples are often found in such
collections as that formed in the seventeenth century
by John Bagford, the biblioclast, which is now in the
British Museum. No doubt, too, heraldic painters or
plate engravers collected book-plates as specimens of
heraldry, but this was not collecting them as book-plates&mdash;viz.
as illustrations of the custom of placing
marks of ownership in books, which, I take it, was
evidently Miss Jenkins's object.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p>Still, though little was written on the subject of
book-plates prior to 1880, it by no means follows
that for some years before that date there had not
been a considerable number of persons who took an
interest in the subject. The fact is, that the book-plate
collector of earlier days was wiser in his generation
than are those of his kind to-day. He kept his
'hobby' to himself, and was thus enabled to indulge
it economically. My father had a small collection;
and I can well remember how, as a boy, I used to
help him to add to it. We used to go to a shop in a
dingy street, leading off Oxford Street, and there
select from a large clothes-basket as many book-plates
as were new to our collection. The price was one
penny a piece,&mdash;new or old, dated or undated, English
or foreign, that of Bishop Burnet, or David Garrick,
or Mr. Jones, or Mr. Brown,&mdash;all alike, a penny a
piece; and I have no doubt, though I do not remember
the fact, there was the usual 'reduction on
taking a quantity.' I think this shop was almost the
only one in London where you could buy book-plates
at all. Well, those days are past now; and, whilst
we regret them, because book-plate collecting is no
longer an economical pursuit, we cannot allow our
regret to be unmingled with satisfaction. The
would-be collector of to-day can, if he pleases,
know something about the collection he is undertaking;
he can tell when he meets with a good
specimen; he knows the points which render any
particular book-plate interesting; and he can, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
least approximately, affix a date to each example
he obtains.</p>

<p>As to the morality of book-plate collecting, I
suppose something ought to be said here. There is
but one objection to it, but that is, undoubtedly, a
serious one: taking a book-plate out of a book means
the possible disfigurement and injury of the volume
from which it is taken; yet, for the purpose of study
and comparison, the removal is a distinct advantage.
To confess this seems, at first sight, to bring collecting
at all under a sweeping condemnation; and such,
indeed, would be the case, were it not for the fact
that damage to, or even the actual destruction of,
very many books is really a matter of no consequence
whatever. Book-plates are found quite as
often in the worthless literary productions of our
ancestors as in the worthy; and it is puerile to cavil
over the removal of a book-plate from a binding
which holds together material by the destruction of
which the world would certainly not be the poorer.
So much for the book-plates in valueless books. As
regards those in valuable or interesting ones, it is
certainly unwise to remove them at all. This is a
golden rule which cannot be too forcibly impressed
upon collectors and booksellers. The case does not
occur very often; and when it does, the book itself,
with the book-plate in it, can be easily fetched and
placed beside the 'collection' when needed for comparison.
It may happen that the book-plate in this
valuable book is interesting from the fact that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
belonged to some man of note, or that it is unique;
if so, we have only a further reason against taking it
out of the volume. The value of a very early book-plate,
when preserved in the volume in which it is
discovered, is lessened almost to a vanishing point if
separated from that volume. Pasted into a book as
a mark of ownership, it is an undoubted book-plate;
whereas, if taken out and fastened into a collection
of book-plates, it at once loses the proof of its
original use, so essential to its value and so material
to the student of book-plates.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as I have said, there is no harm
in removing, from some uninteresting and valueless
volume, the book-plate of a famous man. Everybody
knows that Bishop Burnet or David Garrick had
plenty of what they themselves regarded as 'rubbish'
in their libraries; so that Burnet's book-plate in an
actually valueless volume does not prove that the
Bishop's shrewd eye ever scanned its pages, or that
his episcopal hand ever held it. Besides, I know as a
fact that it is a not uncommon trick for the possessor
of the book-plate of some famous man to affix that
book-plate in a worthless volume, and then offer the
whole for sale at a price much higher than would
be asked or obtained for the book-plate itself, though
the value of the book may be <i>nil!</i></p>

<p>Without quarrelling with the name book-plate,&mdash;as
applied to the marks of ownership pasted into
books,&mdash;and without wasting time with discussion of
suggestions for a better one, it may be admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
that the word is not altogether happily chosen. It
perhaps suggests to the mind of the 'uninitiated' an
illustration in a book rather than a mark of possession.
But then at the present day there are not
many 'uninitiated' amongst either buyers or sellers
of books and prints, so that the inappropriateness of
the name need not concern us.</p>

<p>As to its antiquity, that is doubtful; but probably
one of the earliest instances of its use, in print,
occurs in 1791, when John Ireland published the first
two volumes of his <i>Hogarth Illustrated</i>. In this
work he says that the works of Callot were probably
Hogarth's first models, and 'shop bills and <i>book-plates</i>
his first performances.' Again, in 1798, Ireland
refers to the 'book-plate' for Lambert the herald-painter,
which Hogarth had executed. In 1823, a
certain 'C. S. B.,' writing in the pages of the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i>, refers to what 'are generally called'
book-plates. His letter was suggested by an article&mdash;a
review of Thomas Moule's <i>Bibliotheca Heraldica</i>&mdash;in
the previous number of the magazine, the writer
of which was evidently not familiar with the term
book-plate as we now apply it, for he calls book-plates
'plates of arms.' We shall see, later on, that
this is quite an inappropriate name; some of the
most interesting and the most beautiful book-plates
have nothing armorial about them.</p>

<p>On the Continent, the term <i>ex libris</i> is generally
applied to book-plates. This is, perhaps, even less
appropriate than book-plate. It is taken from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
two first words of the inscription on a great many
book-plates, when the inscription is written in Latin&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>
'ex libris Johannis Stearne, S.T.P. Episcopi
Clogherensis.' A moment's reflection will show that
this inscription is not intended as a declaration by
the book-plate (should it ever become severed from
the book in which it was fastened) that it came
out of a book belonging to Bishop Stearne; but
that it is a declaration by the <i>book</i> in which the
book-plate is found pasted, that that particular book
is from amongst the books of a particular library,
and ought to be restored to it. It would be as
rational to call book-plates '<i>libri</i>,' because the inscription
on them often begins&mdash;as in a very famous
German book-plate&mdash;'<i>Liber Bilibaldi Pirckheimer</i>.'
It may, indeed, be laid down as a general rule, that
whatever the sentiment expressed on a book-plate, it
is clearly intended to be uttered by the book in which
the book-plate is fixed, not by the book-plate itself.</p>

<p>There are but two instances, quoted by Lord
De Tabley, of the inscription directly referring to
the <i>book-plate</i>. Both are foreign, and date about
the middle of the last century. One is <i>Symbolum
Bibliothec&aelig;</i> of John Bernard Nack, a citizen and
merchant of Frankfort;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and the other, <i>Insigne
Librorum</i>, etc., quoted from the work of M. Poulet
Malassis. Lord De Tabley thinks that the <i>Symbolum</i>
of Herr Nack is simply a trade card; but he
founds this conclusion on the supposition that Herr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Nack was a book-dealer, and that the scene depicted
on his book-plate was, in fact, his shop. In my
opinion, we have in this book-plate a representation
of a portion of Herr Nack's library, in which Minerva(?)
is seated, using the books thereof. A gentleman in
eighteenth century dress, who may, likely enough, be
Herr Nack himself, addresses himself to the goddess,
and explains&mdash;as he points to the outer scene, which
shows us ships and merchandise&mdash;that, whilst following
his trade as a merchant, he still has time to devote
some attention to literature. In any case, these and
the few other instances there may be of the inscription
referring to the book-plate and not to the book, seem
hardly sufficient to make <i>ex libris</i> a good name for
book-plates in general.</p>

<p>Our ancestors, of degrees more remote than grandfather,
do not appear to have referred to book-plates
at all, so we are unable to learn by what name they
would have called them. Pepys, in 1668, speaks of
going to his 'plate-maker's,' and there spending 'an
hour about contriving' his 'little plate' for his books.
This 'little plate' still exists, and is a characteristic
one; it shows us the initials 'S. P.,' with two anchors
and ropes entwined. But we shall speak again of
this, and Sam's other book-plates, later on.</p>

<span class="caption">SIR THOMAS ISHAM&#39;S BOOK-PLATE, BY DAVID LOGGAN.</span>
</div>

<p>David Loggan, a German born, and an engraver
of some note, has, in writing to Sir Thomas Isham in
1676, a no more concise name for Isham's book-plate
than 'a print of your cote of arms.' Loggan, as
a return for many favours, had sent Sir Thomas a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a><br /><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
book-plate designed and executed by himself. 'Sir,'
he says, in the covering letter, 'I send you hier a
Print of your Cote of Armes. I have printed 200
wich I will send with the plate by the next return,
and bege the favor of your keind excepttans of it as a
small Niew yaers Gift or a aknowledgment in part
for all your favors. If anything in it be amies, I
shall be glade to mend it. I have taken the Heralds
painter's derection in it; it is very much used amongst
persons of Quality to past ther Cotes of Armes befor
ther bookes instade of wreithing ther Names.'</p>

<p>The 'Heralds painter' was, unfortunately, wrong in
his treatment of the Isham 'coat,' and so Loggan's
work, artistic as it might be, could not be acceptable
to Sir Thomas, to whom a mistake in the
family escutcheon was no light matter. This he
evidently told David, who, a few days after, writes
to him again:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I ame sorry that the Cote is wronge; I have
taken the herald's derection in it, but the Foole did
give it wrong.... The altering of the plate will be
very trubelsom, and therfor you will be presented
with a newe one, wich shall be don without falt, and
that very sudenly. And if you plase, Sir, to give
thies plate and the prints to your Brothers, it will
serve for them.'</p>

<p>These Isham book-plates are really very beautiful
pieces of work. A reproduction of one of them may
be seen on the foregoing page. This is evidently
the one first executed, the omission of the mark of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
baronetcy&mdash;the 'bloody hand of Ulster'&mdash;and the
helmet of an esquire instead of a knight or baronet
clearly constituting the blunder into which Loggan
had fallen. By the kindness of Sir Charles Isham,
the present baronet, I have been enabled to see a
copy of the corrected design sent by Loggan, which
is in all respects accurate. This was doing duty as
a book-plate in a volume in which it had evidently
been placed at the time it was received by Sir Thomas.</p>

<p>Nicholas Carew, afterwards Sir Nicholas Carew,
Baronet, records in his accounts, on the 19th February
1707, a payment for his book-plate, which is
dated in that year, as follows:&mdash;'For coat of arms
impressing, 1<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.;</i>' and a few months later is a
payment 'For 300 armes, 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>'</p>

<p>'The mark of my books,' is the phrase which
Andrew Lumisden applies to the book-plate engraved
for him by his brother-in-law, Sir Robert Strange,
about the year 1746. The plate is an interesting one,
and by an interesting man, of whom we shall speak
later on. Lumisden thought well of it, and thus
refers to the work in a letter written from Rouen,
in June 1748:&mdash;'I am very anxious to know if my
brother continues his resolution of coming to this
country. If he does, I can luckily be of use to him
in the way of his business, from the acquaintance I
have of a very ingenious person, professor of the
Academy of Design here ... I show'd him, a few
days ago, <i>the mark of my books</i>, from which he entertains
a high notion of Robie's abilities.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a curious advertisement, quoted by Thomas
Moule in his <i>Bibliotheca Heraldica</i>, of a certain
Joseph Barber, a Newcastle-on-Tyne 'bookseller,
music and copper-plate publisher,' who, in 1742,
resided in 'Humble's Buildings.' In that year he
engraved the 'Equestrian Statue of King James [II.],'
which once stood in the Sandhill Market. If a
moment's digression be allowed, the history of this
statue is worth telling. On 16th March 1685, the
Town Council voted &pound;800 for the erection of 'a figure
of His Majesty in a Roman habit, on a capering horse,
in copper, as big as the figure of His Majesty, King
Charles <span class='small'>I.</span>, at Charing Crosse, on a pedestal of black
marble.' A certain Mr. William Larson executed it;
Sir Christopher Wren expressed his approval, and
everybody was very pleased, for a year or two. But
popular feeling soon changed in Newcastle, as elsewhere,
and the prevalence of sentiments which threw
the king off his throne threw his metal representation
into the Tyne, where it rested till fished out to be
melted down and used to make a set of church bells.
The drawing of the luckless statue was safe in the
keeping of Sir Hans Sloane; and from this, Barber
made his engraving, which he sold for 5s. The fact
that in 1742, three years before the second Scotch
rebellion, this Newcastle printseller found it worth
while to issue the engraving at all, is not without
political significance. With his engraving, Barber
issued two large plates of the arms of all the subscribers
to it, each coat of arms being 1&frac34; inches in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
length, and 1&frac14; inches in breadth; and a few years
later, it seems to have occurred to him that he might
turn an honest penny by cutting up these large sheets
of the subscribers' arms, so that each coat of arms
became a separate plate. Having done this, he issued
an advertisement to the subscribers, in which he sets
forth that he is 'the sole proprietor of each of their
plates,' and is willing to part with it, to the lady or
gentleman whose arms are engraved thereon, 'together
with one hundred prints of it on a good paper,'
for the modest sum of half-a-crown. These plates,
suggests Mr. Barber, might be advantageously used
as what we now call book-plates, and he continues:
'The design of this proposal is a useful and necessary
embellishment, and a remedy against losing books
by lending, or having them stolen; by pasting one
print on the inside of the cover of each book, you
have the owner's name, coat of arms, and place of
abode; a thing so useful and the charge so easy, 'tis
hoped will meet with encouragement. To have a
plate engraved will cost 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>'</p>

<p>From all which it may be inferred that Mr. Joseph
Barber thought&mdash;or wanted other people to think&mdash;that
the idea of using a book-plate was his own.
Newcastle people, in 1743, must have been very unobservant
of the habits of their neighbours if they
believed Mr. Barber; for the fashion of using a book-plate&mdash;which
in England came in some forty years
before&mdash;was by that time general throughout the
country. That some of the subscribers accepted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
offer, and got their 'hundred plates on a good paper'
for half-a-crown, is demonstrated by the existence of
copies of the plates published with the 'equestrian
statue,' being still found in books, doing duty as book-plates.
Very poor productions they are, reflecting
but slight credit on the designer or engraver. But
what Joseph lacked in art, he atoned for in enterprise;
we see this in his ingenious way of getting rid
of his old copper-plates, and the postscript to his advertisement
demonstrates the fact even more plainly,
for on a day near at hand, the advertisement tells us,
was to be fought, at a neighbouring cock-pit, 'a Welsh
main,' and the prize was to be nothing less than one
of the advertiser's engravings, 'a pretty piece of work,
worthy the observation of the curious.' If the term
book-plate had been known in Barber's day, it would
probably have found its way into his advertisement,
which is clumsy from the want of a word to express
the very thing he is advertising.</p>

<p>William Stephens, who engraved a good many
book-plates in his time, could find no better expression
than 'print of your arms' to describe the 800
book-plates which, for half-a-guinea, he sent to Dr.
Samuel Kerrich, the Shakespearian student, in 1754.</p>

<p>Horace Walpole, again, would, I think, have used
the phrase 'book-plate' had he known it. In his
<i>Catalogue of Engravers</i>&mdash;the edition of 1771&mdash;he
speaks of George Vertue having engraved 'a plate to
put in Lady Oxford's books'; and in his <i>Anecdotes
of Painting</i>, he refers to the 'plate' which Hogarth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
'used for his books.' One of his own book-plates&mdash;that
engraved soon after 1791&mdash;Walpole describes as
his 'seal': <i>Sigillum Horatii Comitis de Orford;</i> but
this phrase is, I think, used simply because the book-plate
itself is the representation of a medi&aelig;val seal.
Bartolozzi&mdash;giving, in 1796, a receipt for a book-plate
which he had just completed&mdash;refers to it as a 'ticket-plate'
(see <a href="#Page_94">p. 94</a>); but he was a foreigner, and may
not have known the English name for such things,
for we have seen that, some five years before, Ireland
refers to Hogarth's 'book-plate.' Charles James Fox,
in a note, dated at Leicester on 2nd August 1801,
speaks of the 'book-plate' of his great-great-grandfather,
Sir Stephen Fox.</p>

<p>But, though the phrase 'book-plate' may have been
occasionally used at the close of the last century and
the beginning of the present, it was then by no means
widely used; and although the writer quoted on
page 6 refers in 1823 to what are 'generally called'
book-plates, William Wadd, in 1827, can find no direct
term by which to refer to these marks of ownership.
Speaking in <i>Mems., Maxims, and Memoirs</i>, he says:
'In the Library of the Royal College of Surgeons,
there are many volumes, formerly the property of the
celebrated Douglas, having his arms embellished with
various kinds of surgical instruments, which was by
no means an uncommon practice, as in the Library
of the College of Physicians there are many examples
of volumes where the former possessor has not only
blazoned his own arms, but borrowed the arms of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
college and super-added supporters, as Apollo, Mercury,
&AElig;sculapius, and his daughter Hygeia.'</p>

<p>Lord Byron, too, did not, I fancy, know the word
'book-plate' in its now-used sense; writing to a fair
admirer, who had apparently designed one of these
for him, he says: 'I received the arms, my dear
Miss &mdash;&mdash;, and am very much obliged to you for the
trouble you have taken. It is impossible I should
have any fault to find with them. The sight of the
drawing gives me great pleasure for a double reason:
in the first place they will ornament my books, and
in the next they convince me that you have not
entirely forgot me.'<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>So the term book-plate is only a century old, and the
fashion of collecting book-plates much more modern
still; but the use of book-plates is really of respectable
antiquity, and is a matter on which we may now appropriately
speak. Whether, in the first instance, the
use of book-plates was suggested by a desire to commemorate
a gift, or as a mark of ownership, seems
to be a matter on which a variety of opinions exist.
Some of the earliest mechanically produced book-plates
are certainly commemorative of gifts (see <a href="#Page_114">p. 114</a>);
but I think we must accept as book-plates, to all intents
and purposes, the six fourteenth century examples
mentioned by Herr Warnecke in his <i>Die Deutschen
B&uuml;cherzeichen</i>, an excellent work on German book-plates.
These are heraldic coloured drawings on the
parchment leaves of Italian manuscripts, which also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
bear an inscription of possession by the particular
individuals whose arms are represented.</p>

<p>But, of course, the real necessity for book-plates,
whatever may have been their original use, began
when the printing-press gave to the world not two
nor three, but a hundred or more copies of a particular
book. Then it was that the different owners
needed to distinguish their respective copies of a
work; for the professional book-borrower, who would
gladly have retained the manuscript volume lent to
him by an unsuspecting friend, could he have done so
without his crime being detected, doubtless saw in
the multitude of copies a greater opportunity of
carrying out his nefarious designs. The existence of
book-plates is, therefore, largely due to the literary
enthusiast who amasses a library by retaining volumes
received on loan; the inscriptions on some of the
earlier book-plates prove this to be so.</p>

<p>The earliest printed book-plates are certainly
German, and there is little doubt that some of
these are nearly contemporary with the very early
printed books on the oak covers of which they may
still be found pasted. By the commencement of the
sixteenth century book-plates were frequently fine
examples of the wood-engraver's art. Albert D&uuml;rer
himself designed book-plates; and of these, one of
the most elaborate and the best known is that of his
friend Bilibald Pirckheimer, the Nuremberg jurist,
whose portrait he engraved on copper in 1524. The
book-plate is still earlier.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>England can now&mdash;thanks to recent investigations&mdash;claim
the second place in the chronological
sequence of countries in which book-plates have been
used. Cardinal Wolsey's book-plate (see <a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>) is
probably not later in date than 1525. France can
boast of a book-plate dated in 1574; Sweden of one
dated in the following year, and Switzerland of one
in 1607; Italy in 1623: in other European countries,
dated examples do not appear, nor does the practice
of using book-plates seem to have been adopted until
considerably later.</p>

<p>In concluding this opening chapter, let me say a
word about the position in a book in which a book-plate
should be looked for. The usual place was
certainly on the front cover of a volume; sometimes
another copy of the same plate was fastened to the
back cover; and sometimes&mdash;as in Pirckheimer's
case, just noticed, and in that of Samuel Pepys (see
<a href="#Page_216">p. 216</a>)&mdash;the same person would use a different book-plate
at the back of the volume to that used at the
front. Another plan, less frequent, but by no means
uncommon, was to insert the book-plate on the title-page,
often on the back of it; and another, to fasten
the book-plate into the volume, by pasting its right-hand
margin about a quarter of an inch on to the
title-page, so that the book-plate would fold over and
face it. This is a plan that leads to a book-plate
being most easily overlooked.</p>

<p>Collectors should also note that, in many instances,
book-plates are found in a variety of sizes; this should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
certainly be borne in mind when setting aside any
particular specimen as a duplicate. In the present
day, most people are content to have a book-plate
small enough to go into a volume of any size; its
dwarfed appearance on the cover of a full-sized folio
is no eyesore to them, or, if it is, the pleasure of
economy makes them bear with it. But in days gone
by it was&mdash;especially in Germany&mdash;certainly otherwise.
The possession of a large library would necessitate,
in the owner's mind, the possession of a number
of differently sized book-plates, in order to get one
which would neither look too small in the largest
volume, nor be too large for the smallest! Some of
the most noble foreign examples, rich in detail and
bold in general effect, are those that belonged to
men who liked to have for their folios a book-plate
of proportionate size. There are no very large
English book-plates, but plenty of library owners in
this country had two or three different sized book-plates,
and the late Sir William Stirling-Maxwell
boasted of over a hundred varieties!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE EARLY USE OF BOOK-PLATES IN ENGLAND</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">In</span> a short paper, which in 1882 I contributed to
the <i>Antiquarian Magazine and Bibliographer</i>, I wrote
this passage:&mdash;'It is difficult to believe that the
general use of book-plates should have been a
hundred and fifty years in reaching this country
from the Continent; and yet there is rather more
difference than that between the date on the earliest-known
German example (1516) and the time when
English-dated specimens appear at all plentifully.
Surely the many English men of letters who amassed
large libraries in the sixteenth century, and the first
half of the seventeenth, must have possessed book-plates;
and yet, where are their book-plates now?</div>

<p>'Many, no doubt, have perished with the bindings
to which they were fastened, but some are doubtless
still extant; and we may yet hope that, when the
interest in these labels becomes more widely diffused,
more than one or two specimens will be brought to
light, bearing an engraved date sufficiently early to
dispel the idea that this country was a century and
a half behind its German neighbours in the general
practice of using book-plates.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Daniel Parsons, who may be properly called
the father of book-plate literature,&mdash;his contribution,
in 1837, to 'The Third Annual Report of the Oxford
University Arch&aelig;ological and Heraldic Society,' was
certainly the first paper on the subject that ever
appeared,&mdash;commented on this hope of mine in the
number of the same magazine issued in the following
January, and was despondent as to evidence being
forthcoming to prove the early use of book-plates in
England.</p>

<p>Well, in that I expressed the belief that investigation
would bring to light a number of sixteenth and
seventeenth century <i>dated</i> book-plates, I was perhaps
wrong&mdash;early English dated book-plates have not
been found in anything approaching plenty; but
I was also wrong in suggesting that proof of the
early use of book-plates in this country could only be
proved by dated examples; the existence of examples
which, from internal evidence, are proved to be of
early date is really equally valuable; and as these
have certainly come to light in considerable numbers,
I think a good case has been made out on behalf of
our fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>I do not pretend that early English book-plates
are so plentiful as those of Germany. Some individual
specimens are known to exist; but there are
very few that are recorded as existing in more than
a few collections, and some are unique. From some
cause or other, early English book-plates are a rarity;
and I propose, therefore, to speak individually of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
majority of them,&mdash;that is to say, of those executed
prior to the close of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>But before doing this, let me say a word as to the
date at which the colours intended to be shown on
the shield of arms were first represented by lines or
points. For instance, perpendicular lines from the
top to the bottom of the shield, thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 229px;">
<img src="images/i_038a.jpg" width="229" height="246" alt="Striped shield" />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>to express <i>gules</i>&mdash;red.</div>

<p>A number of small dots or points, thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 222px;">
<img src="images/i_038b.jpg" width="222" height="238" alt="Dotted shield" />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>to express <i>or</i>&mdash;gold; and so on.</div>

<p>To whom may be attached the credit of inventing
this useful system, matters little; what we are now
interested in&mdash;for the purpose of considering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
approximate dates of book-plates&mdash;is the time at
which it was first employed in heraldic engravings.
Mr. Walter Hamilton, in the pages of the <i>Ex Libris
Journal</i>, realises the importance of the subject. He
speaks of the work by Father Silvester Petra-Sancta,
published at Rome in 1638, in which the proposal is
advocated, and refers to M. Henri Bouchot's allusion
to a work by Vulsson de la Colombi&egrave;re, written in
1639, which advocates the system.</p>

<p>That, at an earlier date, lines running all in one
direction were used only as shading, is shown over
and over again. Take, for instance, the book-plate of
Francis de Malherbe (reproduced over leaf), which, as
the owner died in 1628, was engraved, probably, soon
after the opening of the century. In this case we
have a statement by De Malherbe that his arms are
'D'argent &agrave; six roses de gueules, et des hermines
de sable sans nombre,'&mdash;a description obviously inaccurate.
De Malherbe was a poet, and could no
more be expected to describe a coat of arms than
'Garter' could be expected to write a poem. The
proper blazoning of his family arms is: ermine, six
roses gules. But, according to the lines depicted on
his book-plate, the 'field' would be <i>azure:</i> clearly, in
this case, the lines mean nothing at all.</p>

<p>The late Mr. J. E. Bailey points out that in the
1562, 1568, and 1576 editions of Gerard Legh's
<i>Accedens of Armory</i>, sable (black) is expressed, as it
would be now, by horizontal and perpendicular lines
crossing each other; whilst the other colours are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
represented by the initials of their names. It is
possible that this form of expressing sable may be
merely the result of an attempt on the part of the
engraver to produce as dark a tint as possible to
represent it. In Vincent's <i>Discovery of Brooke's
Errors</i>, 1622, such lines are certainly used as shading,
or to distinguish colour from white; but, as shown
from his verbal description of the arms he represents,
these lines are used without any system whatever,
perpendicular lines sometimes representing gules, and
sometimes azure. Again, in the second edition of
Guillim's <i>Display</i>, 1632, lines are used to denote the
darker colours, though they are used without system.
But in 1654, we find, in Bysshe's heraldic tracts,
gules, azure, sable, and the rest expressed in the
now orthodox manner, and an explanatory plate
showing what colours are represented by the respective
dots or lines, a conclusive proof of the novelty of
the system in England. I think the reader will see,
as he proceeds, that this has been a useful digression.</p>

<span class="caption">BOOK-PLATE OF FRANCIS DE MALHERBE.</span>
</div>

<p>We have said that the earliest English book-plate
yet come to light is Cardinal Wolsey's. This is not
a printed book-plate at all, but a carefully drawn
sketch of the Cardinal's arms, with supporters, and
surmounted by a Cardinal's hat, the whole coloured
by hand. How many of these book-plates the
Cardinal possessed, we do not know; but that this&mdash;the
only example known&mdash;is undoubtedly a book-plate,
is proved from the fact that it may now be seen
in a folio volume which once belonged to Wolsey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a><br /><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and subsequently to his royal master. It bears no
date, and may have been designed any time after the
minister's elevation to the cardinalate in September
1514. It is a splendid affair in every way, and
gorgeously coloured. The shield of arms rests on a
platform (gold), the front of which is red, ornamented
with an arabesque pattern, also red; pillars
on the platform support a canopy, ornamented as the
front of the platform, with the addition of Tudor
roses; over the shield is the Cardinal's hat, and above
that again the holy dove descends. The shield is
supported by two dingy-looking griffins, whose wings
and heads are red, and whose beaks, claws, and tail-tips
are gold; the background is blue.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 443px;"><a id="BACON"></a>
<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="443" height="578" alt="Bacon's book-plate" />
<span class="caption">BOOK-PLATE OF SIR NICHOLAS BACON</span>
</div>

<p>Next in date, after Wolsey's book-plate, comes that
which was, I believe, engraved at least contemporaneously
with the date upon it, 1574, to place in the
volumes given in that year by Sir Nicholas Bacon to
the University of Cambridge. Bacon died five years
after this date; he is familiar to us all as 'the father
of his country and of Sir Francis Bacon.' This book-plate
is engraved on wood; like Wolsey's, it is found
coloured, but it is also&mdash;amongst the odds and ends
in the Bagford Collection&mdash;found uncoloured, and
without the inscription which records the gift to
Cambridge. A facsimile of that in the Bagford
Collection appears opposite: can it be the book-plate
of Bacon himself, to which, on the copies used for
the books that he gave to Cambridge, was added
the donatory inscription? A close comparison shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a><br /><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
that both shields of arms are struck from the same
block. The arms shown are Bacon quartering
Quaplode. The variety of this book-plate which
bears the inscription belongs to what are termed
'gift' or 'legacy' book-plates, the dates on which&mdash;as
they refer to the date of the 'gift' or 'legacy'
commemorated&mdash;are considered <i>earlier</i> than the engraving.
In the case of 'legacy' book-plates they
may often be so, but they are not, I think, in many
cases of 'gift' book-plates. For instance, if (as from
the Bagford example seems probable) this was
Bacon's own book-plate, the date upon it, 1574, may
even be many years <i>later</i> than the time at which
it was made for him. That the date on one of
these 'gift' book-plates must be, within a very short
space of time, the date of its engraving, will be shown
presently when I come to speak of that recording a
donation made by Lady Bath.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 505px;"><a id="Tresham"></a>
<img src="images/i_045.jpg" width="505" height="600" alt="Tresham's book-plate" />
</div>

<p>The next English book-plate which bears upon it an
engraved date is that of Sir Thomas Tresham. On
this the inscription reads 'June 29, 1585,' which no
doubt refers to the date of engraving, or, probably, to
the date at which the design for the engraving was
finished by the artist. As a work of art it is poor,
but its interest as a book-plate to collectors is not
lessened on that account. Tresham was knighted by
Queen Elizabeth ten years before the date of his
book-plate. We know not much of him, save what
Fuller tells us that he was famous for 'his skill in
buildings.' One of his sons, Sir Francis, was involved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a><br /><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
in the Gunpowder Plot, and another, Sir Lewis, was
made a baronet in 1611.</p>

<p>These three examples are all the sixteenth century
English dated book-plates yet brought to light. Those
in the seventeenth century are far more numerous. We
find one bearing the date '1613,' which was prepared
to place in the volumes given, in that year, by William
Willmer, a Northamptonshire squire, to his college
library. The inscription on it reads: 'Sydney Sussex
Colledge&mdash;Ex dono Wilhelmi Willmer de Sywell in
Com. Northamtoni&aelig;, Armigeri, quondam pentionarii
in ista Domi (<i>sic</i>), viz. in Anno D&ntilde;i 1599; sed
dedit in Ano D&ntilde;i 1613.' The book-plate is clearly
early, and shows us fine bold heraldic work. In
style it nearly resembles the Bacon plate, and that
of Sir Thomas Tresham; but the mantling here
descends to the base of the shield. The Willmer
plate is in Dr. Howard's Collection; a reproduction
of it is given in Mr. Griggs's <i>Examples of Armorial
Book-Plates</i>.</p>

<p>Early in the reign of Charles <span class='small'>I.</span> may be placed a
very beautiful example of heraldic engraving, which
Sir Wollaston Franks satisfactorily assigns to a certain
John Talbot of Thorneton, who died in 1659. It
is inscribed 'Coll. Talbott,' and this John Talbot is
called 'Colonellus ex parte Regis'; the quarterings
are those of the families of Ferrers, Bellars, and
Arderne.</p>

<p>In strange contrast to this fine work is the wood
block book-plate of 'William Courtenay of Treemer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
in the county of Cornwall, Esquire,' who, in 1632,
inherited the Treemer estate. We may note that,
not only is this book-plate, like all those yet described,
free from any indication of lines or dots to
express the colours in the armorial bearings, but
below the shield is given a verbal blazon of the coat:
'He beareth <i>or</i>, 3 Torteauxes.'</p>

<p>This seems to be the place to speak of a very
puzzling pair of engravings, which certainly appear
to have been used as book-plates, dated in 1630.
They represent the armorial bearings of Sir Edward
Dering. One of these book-plates which I take to
be the earlier, shows a less number of quarterings,
and contains no indication of a really systematic
expression of the metals and tinctures in the arms;
but the other and later example does. The same
date appears upon each. The second of the two plates
occurs bound up in a volume of the Harleian Collection
of MSS.; and 'Mr. Humphrey Wanly, library-keeper
to Robert and Edward, Earls of Oxford,'
in his description of the specimen in the Harleian
Collection, calls it 'A printed cut of the Arms or
Atchievement of Sir Edward Dering, Baronet, dated
<span class='small'>A.D.</span> 1630, with a fanciful motto in misshapen Saxon
characters; but by the hatching of the arms in order
to show the colours, according to the way found out
by Sir Edward Bysshe, I guess that it is not so old.'</p>

<p>Now, the Harleian volume, in which this engraving
occurs, is a copy, written in 1645-46, of the Heralds'
Visitation of Kent in 1619; and in a later, but certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
seventeenth century, handwriting, is a description of
the numerous quarterings as they appear on the
engraving; so that, whilst rejecting the claim of this
variety of the plate to be an engraving of 1630, we
may, I think, accept it as at least an early example of
the indication of the colours and tinctures by lines and
dots. As for the first of the two varieties, I do not
see why it should not be as early as the date upon it;
there was no particular reason in selecting that date;
for I do not find that it refers to any special event
in Sir Edward's life. A writer to <i>Notes and Queries</i>,
in 1851, states that there were several 'loose copies'
of the plate&mdash;which variety, he does not say&mdash;in the
Surrenden Collection, and Dr. Howard saw it 'inserted'
in several folio volumes of that collection,
when it was disposed of by Messrs. Puttick and
Simpson. Very good facsimiles of these book-plates
have been given by Dr. Howard in his <i>Miscellanea
Genealogica et Heraldica</i>.</p>

<p>Another early instance of the expression of the
metals and tinctures occurs in the book-plate of Lord-Keeper
Lyttelton, a plate which derives additional
interest from the fact of its being the work of
William Marshall, the famous frontispiece engraver.
Sir Edward Lyttelton, the owner of the book-plate,
was made Lord-Keeper in 1641, under the title of
Baron Lyttelton of Mounslow. This book-plate,
which shows us the arms of Lyttelton of Frankley,
was evidently engraved before Sir Edward's elevation
to the peerage. The book-plate, which is the earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
English example bearing an engraver's signature,
may be dated about 1640.</p>

<p>We know from the arms on dedication plates, and
the like, that the expression of colours on shields
did not become at all general for many years after
1640. Take, for instance, Hollar's cuts of arms in
the illustrations to Dugdale's <i>Monasticon</i>, or his
<i>History of St. Paul's</i>. Thus, we must not date every
book-plate we find, on which the colours are not
shown in the new fashion, as before 1640. The
small and unpretentious book-plate of John Marsham
of Whom's Place, near Cuxton, in Kent, is an illustration
of this. A representation of it is given by
Mr. Griggs in his <i>Facsimiles</i>. Marsham was made a
baronet in 1663; so the plate is earlier than that, but
as it is exactly in the style of the dedicatory plates
in the works just noticed, we may place it somewhere
about 1655. It is perhaps by Hollar. Likely
enough, other examples will come to light.</p>

<p>After the Restoration, the number of English
book-plates perceptibly increases, though we must
remember that the active supporters of Cromwell
did not object to a little heraldic display&mdash;there
was a fair amount of heraldic work one way and
another, executed both with pen and pencil, during
the twelve years that the king was kept off his
throne. Two of the earliest post-Restoration book-plates
are those of Sir Edward Bysshe and his
brother-in-law, John Greene. Sir Edward Bysshe
became Garter King-at-Arms, and John Greene was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of Navestock, Essex. Both are curious oblong
plates, having fancifully shaped shields surrounded
by palm branches, and held up by ribbons. There
is no crest shown in either. They are evidently by
the same artist, which, as Bysshe and Greene were
brothers-in-law, is perhaps natural. A somewhat
similar, though plainer, form of ornamentation surrounds
the shields on two other anonymous book-plates,
one bearing the arms of Southwell, and the
other those of Eynes or Haynes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 368px;"><a id="BURGHERS"></a>
<img src="images/i_051.jpg" width="368" height="600" alt="BURGHERS bookplate" />
<span class="caption">BOOK-PLATE OF THOMAS GORE BY MICHAEL BURGHERS.</span>
</div>

<p>Thomas Gore of Alderton, Wilts, the author of
<i>Catalogus de Re Heraldic&acirc;</i>, is a man who might be
expected to use a book-plate, and he did. Three
varieties are known. The first, which dates about
1660, though a more elaborate piece of work than
those last described, is somewhat similar in style, or
perhaps it would be more accurate to say dissimilar
to the style in which other book-plates prior to
the Restoration were designed. Whoever engraved
this plate for Gore also engraved the arms of Edward
Waterhouse&mdash;most probably the engraving was intended
for Waterhouse's book-plate&mdash;which appear
as a frontispiece to his <i>Discourse and Defence of
Arms and Armory</i>, 1660. In his second book-plate
Gore called to his aid the foreigner's art, employing
Michael Burghers, a Dutch artist, who had recently
come from Holland and settled at Oxford. Michael
produced the book-plate figured opposite, which
introduces some rather wild allegory, singularly plain
cupids seated on the backs of flying eagles. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a><br /><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Gore did not care for this allegory,&mdash;allegory seems
never to have been popular with English book-plate
owners (see <a href="#Page_72">Chapter <span class='small'>IV.</span></a>),&mdash;and for his third plate
went to an Englishman, and to a no less eminent
one than William Faithorne. The famous portrait-engraver
produced as beautiful and bold a book-plate
in the Simple Armorial style as could well be:
the peculiar 'depth' of his touch is apparent here and
in his other book-plates, of which there are several.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 328px;"><a id="MARRIOTT"></a>

<span class="caption">BOOK-PLATE OF THE MARRIOTT FAMILY BY FAITHORNE</span>
</div>

<p>It is interesting to note that Faithorne reverts to
the pre-Restoration style, and improves upon it. The
mantling is much richer than that shown in earlier
examples in the same style, and it more completely
surrounds the shield. To Faithorne may be assigned
two other magnificent book-plates, that of Sir George
Hungerford of Cadenham (anonymous), and the
one here reproduced of a member of the family of
Marriott of Whitchurch, Warwickshire, and Alscot
and Preston, Gloucestershire.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The Hungerford book-plate
is noteworthy. The name of Sir George Hungerford,
its possessor, does not occur in any list of
baronets, yet he evidently considered himself to
possess that dignity, as the 'bloody hand of Ulster'
figures on his arms. Dugdale, too, in speaking of
Sir George's marriage, refers to him as 'baronet.'
Faithorne also produced a book-plate to commemorate
a gift of books made by Bishop Hacket, who
died in 1670&mdash;it is particularly curious as showing us
the Bishop's portrait. I shall speak of it later on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a><br /><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>

such plates are comparatively few in number.</p>

<p>Dated, and most probably engraved, in the following
year, 1671, is another 'gift' book-plate, prepared
to place in books presented by the then Countess-Dowager
of Bath. The inscription reads: 'Ex dono
Rachel Comitiss&aelig; Bathon: Dotari&aelig; An: Dom.
<span class='small'>MDCLXXI.</span>' This lady was born in 1613; she was
a daughter of Francis Fane, first Earl of Westmoreland,
and became the wife of Henry Bourchier, Earl
of Bath, who died in 1654; and soon afterwards of
Lionel Cranfield, Earl of Middlesex, who died in
1674; she herself dying in 1680. There is no reason
to doubt the date on this book-plate, 1671, though, at
first sight, it may look a little suspicious. True, she
had become the wife of the Earl of Middlesex (a title
only dating from 1622) in 1654, and was still his wife
in 1671; but she had apparently little reason to be
proud of him or his title, for he left her and made
hay of her fortune, spending it to use the words of
a contemporary letter,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> 'in play and rioting.' We
cannot, therefore, feel much surprised at her desire to
pass by her former title which would give her rank
at court as the widow of an Earl whose creation was
hard on a century earlier. 'Our cousin, Lady Bath,'
writes Lady Newport, in April 1661, 'hath got her
place of being Lady Bath again; it cost her 1,200<i>l</i>
... her Lord is very angry at her changing her title;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
he says it is an affront to him.' That is why she
calls herself, on the book-plate under notice, Countess-Dowager
of Bath in 1671. A curious feature about
the book-plate is, that it does not seem to have been
prepared to place in books included in one particular
gift to a particular person or institution, but rather to
have been the outcome of my lady's fancy to place
such a remembrance of herself in any volume she
gave away at that or at any subsequent date. The
Countess also used a book-stamp of the same design
as the <i>ex libris</i>, but without the inscription.</p>

<p>Whilst speaking on the subject of gift book-plates,
reference may appropriately be made to a curious
woodcut used as a book-plate by the St. Albans
Grammar School, which is figured opposite the next
page. It is a quaint bit of, no doubt, local work, and,
as pointed out to me by the Rev. F. Willcox, the
headmaster, during a long and dusty hunt, occurs
only in the volumes given to the school by Sir
Samuel Grimston. The plate shows us a combination
of the arms of the city of St. Albans and the
motto of the Bacon family, adopted by the Grimstons.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that, if a thorough investigation of
the too often neglected libraries of our old foundation
grammar schools were made, other early and curious
book-plates might be discovered.</p>

<p>Between 1670 and 1680 quite a number of book-plates
were designed, evidently by the same man.
The work is feeble, but it is very distinct. The most
interesting of these book-plates, from its possessor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
is that of Samuel Pepys. Altogether, I know
of eight examples: Charles Pitfield, Sir Robert
Southwell, William Wharton, Sir Henry Hunloke,
Samuel Pepys, Justinian Pagit, Walter Chetwynd,
and Randolph Egerton.</p>

<p>A point of interest about them all is that, as well
as expressing heraldically the blazon of the different
shields, they also indicate with an initial letter the
colour intended to be shown: 'a' for argent, 'g' for
gules, and so on. The initial of the heraldic term is
used in every case except that of 'azure,' when 'b' for
blue is used; 'a,' as we have seen, standing for argent.</p>

<p>Though they differ in the arrangement of the mantling,
there can be little doubt that all these book-plates
are by the same hand, and that whoever engraved
the plates in Blome's <i>Gwilim</i>, engraved these also.</p>

<p>The book-plate of 'Fettiplace Nott,' which bears
the date 1694, is a fair type of the book-plate that was
in use in England for the next twenty years; indeed,
these might all be the work of half a dozen artists.</p>

</div>

<p>I have not yet mentioned a very numerous and
very uninteresting class of early English book-plates&mdash;I
mean those which are nothing more than 'name-tickets'&mdash;the
owner's name and date printed within a
border more or less ornate. These occur quite early
in the seventeenth century, and run all through it.
Of course, it may be that the owner is an interesting
person, and then his or her name-ticket becomes interesting
by reflection, but in themselves these tickets
are merely dull. Of English Armorial plates, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a><br /><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
referred in detail to the majority of those bearing
an engraved date&mdash;when that date is not obviously
misleading&mdash;prior to the year 1698. I have also
spoken of several, though by no means all, of the
undated examples, which have been proved to belong
to the seventeenth century. To this second list a
patient working out of the internal evidence on
early-looking, but undated, book-plates would, no
doubt, add very considerably; and the illustrations,
verbal and otherwise, that I have given may, I
hope, be sufficient to indicate the kind of book-plates
that are worth such investigation.</p>

<p>I have used the date 1698 as a stopping-point,
because from that year we have dated examples of
English book-plates, yearly, down to the commencement
of the present century. Here let me say a
word on the subject of dated book-plates generally.
The date is certainly an advantage, especially when
it clearly refers to the date of the engraving, and not,
as we have seen it sometimes does, to an event in the
owner's career; but I cannot understand why the
'market value' of a book-plate should be enhanced
to such an extent as it is by the presence on that
book-plate of an engraved date. There are probably
few book-plates which do not bear some mark by
which an approximate date can be safely affixed to
them, and the study of these marks is a very desirable
undertaking. The great value of a printed date on a
book-plate is that one can see from it the style of
decoration in vogue at a particular period, and thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
obtain the means for arranging, chronologically, undated
examples. For there were during certain years
certain marked styles of decoration adopted by book-plate
engravers; but of these I propose to speak later
on under the heading of 'Styles.'</p>

<p>Let me also mention <i>misleading</i> dates on book-plates,
and for this purpose it will be sufficient if I take
principally the examples cited by Mr. J. Paul Rylands,
F.S.A., in his Notes on Lancashire and Cheshire
examples. The date on Sir William St. Quintin's
book-plate, 1641, is that at which the baronetcy was
created; the book-plate was engraved in the last century.
Sir Francis Fust's book-plate, one remarkable
for its size and ugliness, is inscribed 'S<sup>r</sup> Francis Fust
of Hill Court in the county of Gloucester, Baronet,
created 21st August 1662, the 14 year of King
Charles 2d.' Now this plate cannot be earlier than
1728, the year in which the first 'Sir Francis'
succeeded to the baronetcy. Here, however, the
context of words, 'created 21st August 1662,' renders
the inscription less likely to mislead people into supposing
that 1662 was the year in which the plate was
executed. In other instances we have not this help.</p>

<p>The date 1669, on the book-plate of Gilbert
Nicholson of Balrath, merely refers to the date at
which Gilbert acquired his Irish estates; the example
itself must be later than 1722, as the same
copper was employed for it as that on which the
book-plate of Thomas Carter, dated in that year, had
been engraved. Again, some collectors hold, and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
maintained in print, that the book-plate of Sir Robert
Clayton, of which we must speak again hereafter,
was not really engraved in 1679&mdash;the date which
appears upon it. 1679 is the year in which Sir
Robert was Lord Mayor of London, and it is
thought probable that the book-plate was engraved
later&mdash;perhaps in the early years of the eighteenth
century, when, as we have seen, the fashion of having
a book-plate was so prevalent&mdash;and that Sir Robert
placed the date 1679 upon it in order to commemorate
the date of his mayoralty. For my part, I see
no particular reason for holding this view; the style
in which the plate is executed does not seem to me
contradictory to the date upon it. Still, as the doubt
exists, it is better to mention it.</p>

<p>Attention has been called to a book-plate of
'David Paynter of Dale Castle, Pembrokeshire, 1679,'
which is probably nearly a century later. The book-plate
of 'William Twemlow of Hatherton, Cheshire,
Esquire, 1686,' was engraved for a Mr. William
Twemlow, who died in 1843.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 325px;"><a id="FOX"></a>
<img src="images/i_061.jpg" width="325" height="400" alt="Fox's bookplate: Fox above a helmet above a shield" />
</div>

<p>On the other hand, there are certain book-plates
which were engraved earlier than the dates which
appear upon some impressions of them. The book-plate
of the statesman Charles James Fox (see opposite)
is one instance of this. It is inscribed 'The
Hon<sup>ble</sup> Charles James Fox,' and was used by the
great statesman, but the plate was engraved in 1702&mdash;as
its style suggests&mdash;for his half-uncle, and the
inscription, before its alteration, read:&mdash;'Charles Fox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a><br /><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of the parish of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, Esq.,
1702.'</p>

<p>There is a large book-plate, shown by its style
to have been engraved in the early years of the
eighteenth century, but which is inscribed 'Martin
Stapylton, Esq. of Myton, in the county of York,
<span class='small'>A.D.</span> 1817.' The book-plate was evidently engraved
for Sir Bryan Stapylton, who died in 1727. The
Martin Stapylton who altered and used it was one
Martin Bree&mdash;nephew of the last baronet, who died
in 1817&mdash;who succeeded to his uncle's property, but
not to his baronetcy; hence he was not justified in
leaving the helmet of a knight or baronet upon it; he
removed the 'bloody hand of Ulster' from the shield,
but the mistake in the helmet does not seem to have
struck him. On a small variety of this book-plate,
the inscription on which is similarly altered, the
'bloody hand' remains.</p>

<p>Again, the book-plate of 'S<sup>r</sup> Will<sup>m</sup> Robinson,
Baronett, of Newby, in the county of York, 1702,'
was altered&mdash;by turning the '0' into a '6'&mdash;into 1762,
and was used by his grandson; that inscribed 'John
Peachey, 1782,' designed in the Chippendale style, is
quite twenty years earlier; and that of 'Fr. Dickens
Armig. 1795,' was certainly engraved half a century
before.</p>

<p>During the ten or twelve years immediately following
the year 1698, the number of English dated book-plates
is exceedingly large. Taking the list printed
for private distribution by Sir Wollaston Franks in
1887, we find sixteen examples in 1698; seven in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
1699; fifteen in 1700; sixteen in 1701; forty-four in
1702; fifty-eight in 1703; twenty-seven in 1704;
and many, but not so many, in the succeeding years.
Something&mdash;what, I have failed to discover&mdash;must
have given a stimulus to the fashion of using book-plates
just at the close of the seventeenth and opening
of the eighteenth century; and not only to using
them, but also to putting a date on those used. It is a
fact that it is more rare to find book-plates engraved
in this particular style without dates than
with them.</p>

<p>The fashion of 'dating,' as a rule, went out about
the year 1714, about the time at which, as we shall
see, a new 'style' in book-plates became generally
adopted. Anonymous book-plates are rare after this
date, though, both in England and on the Continent,
they were, in early times, certainly common&mdash;a fact
which bears silent testimony to the much greater
intimacy which people in the good old days had
with their neighbours' armorial bearings. The coat
of arms of a man of position was almost as well
known to those dwelling about him as were the
features of his face; and if a volume, having within
it an Armorial book-plate, happened to be found in
wrongful custody, the finder might recognise the
heraldry of the owner, even if he could not read
the inscription recording that ownership.</p>

<p>So much for the early use of book-plates in
England. In the next chapter I propose to say
something about the leading styles of decoration
employed by their designers.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>'STYLES' IN ENGLISH BOOK-PLATES</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Lord De Tabley</span> has given us names for nearly
all the styles met with in English book-plates, and
it is perhaps better to accept these descriptions in
the present work, adding to them another&mdash;'Simple
Armorial'&mdash;for the earliest plates, and, indeed, for
the great majority of those anterior to 1720.</div>

<p>It is not only in book-plates that we see this style
adopted: it is used in almost every representation of
shields of arms in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, be it on a memorial brass, in sculpture, or
on a stained glass window. The style is simple and
effective. The shield, nearly always symmetrical, is
surmounted by a helmet, on which is the wreath and
crest. From the helmet is outspread more or less
voluminous mantling. In the earlier examples this
terminates, generally in tassels, before reaching the
base of the shield. In later examples its heavy folds
descend quite to the base, and often ascend upwards
from the helmet to the level of the top of the crest.
Below the shield is a narrow scroll for the motto,
which is not always given, and at the bottom of all is
a bracket (on which the owner's name is inscribed),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
having indented edges. Occasionally, but not often,
the mantling, instead of being foliated, hangs from
the helmet in stiff folds at the back of the shield,
its upper corners being tied up and tasselled. The
book-plate of Thomas Knatchbull, dated in 1702
(shown on <a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a>), is a very fair, though not a very
early, example of this style. In some instances the
shield is placed on one side&mdash;its right hand upper
corner being thus brought to the centre of the helmet.
The Simple Armorial style was, roughly speaking,
not much used after 1720.</p>

<p>Besides the book-plates described in the foregoing
chapter, nearly all of which belong to the 'Armorial'
style, there are sundry others worthy of particular
observation, should the reader meet with them.
There is, for instance, the book-plate of 'The Right
Hon<sup>ble</sup> James, Earl of Derby, Lord of Man and ye
Isles, 1702'; the grandson of <i>the</i> James, seventh
Earl, who suffered for his loyalty, and of the gallant
Charlotte Tr&eacute;mouille. This is a large and very
striking book-plate in every way; its size makes
possible the introduction of some fine bold work,
which is rendered even more effective by the fact that
the arms portrayed are simply those of Stanley; so
that there is no crowding in of quarterings. The
decoration is that common to the book-plates of peers,
or of other persons entitled to use supporters at the
time: the mantling spreads from the helmet, and
terminates at the heads of the supporters; these
stand upon the motto-scroll. There is a smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
variety of this book-plate&mdash;one of the ordinary size&mdash;which
is not so pleasing. When Earl James died, in
1736, the Earldom of Derby devolved on his kinsman,
Sir Edward Stanley, Bart., whose book-plate,
larger and finer than that just described, is really a
very beautiful piece of work in the Jacobean style;
the arms are Stanley impaling Hesketh, and the size
of the book-plate is 6<span class='small'><sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> &times; 5<span class='small'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> in.</p>

<p>Similar examples of large-sized book-plates are
furnished by those of 'The Honourable Iames
Brydges of Wilton Castle, in Hereford Shere' (where
the effect is somewhat marred by the number of
quarterings displayed); 'Sir William Brownlowe of
Belton, in the County of Lincoln, Baronet, 1698,' and
his wife 'Dame Alice Brownlowe;' Lord Roos and
his wife, Lady Roos; 'Paul Jodrell of Duffield, in y<sup>e</sup>
County of Derby, Esq<sup>r</sup>, Clerk of y<sup>e</sup> Hon<sup>ble</sup> House of
Commons'&mdash;a particularly bold piece of work; and
'S<sup>r</sup> John Wentworth of North Elmeshall, in the West
Rideing of Yorkshire, Baronet.' It is probable that
all these, and other large-sized English book-plates,
also exist, or existed, in the ordinary size (see <a href="#Page_18">pp. 18</a>,
<a href="#Page_19">19</a>). The largest English book-plate, and one which,
from its unusual size, is certain to attract attention,
is that of 'Simon Scroope of Danby-super-Yore, in
com. Ebor., Esq., 1698'; here, too, much of the good
effect is lost by the number of quarterings (no less
than twenty-seven) introduced upon the shield.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 329px;"><a id="KNATCHBULL"></a>
<img src="images/i_067.jpg" width="329" height="400" alt="Leopard above a helmet above a shield" />
</div>

<p>I referred, at the close of the previous chapter, to
the large number of English book-plates engraved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a><br /><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
during the last two years of the seventeenth century
and first ten of the eighteenth. The great majority
of these book-plates are in the 'Simple Armorial'
style, and there is upon these a very great similarity
in the way in which that style is represented; indeed,
they may well have been, all of them, the work of less
than a dozen artists. Any distinctive feature that
exists is to be found in the treatment of the mantling.
For instance: it is finely cut on the book-plates of
Nicholas Penny, Lord Cornwallis, Lord Roos, and
'John Sayer of Hounslow, in the County of Midd.,
Esq<sup>r</sup>,' all dated in 1700; on the Sayer plate the
inscription is enclosed in a Jacobean scroll; it is
heavy, and stiffly cut in the book-plates of James
Bengough, Richard Newdigate, Sir William Hustler,
and John Godfrey, all dated in 1702; it is leaflike
and graceful on the book-plates of William Thompson
and Francis Columbine, dated in 1708, and of
Thomas Rowney, dated in 1713, whilst the book-plate
of 'Gostlet Harington of Marshfield, in the
Coun. of Glocester, Gent., 1706,' is unique, the
mantling being cut like strawberry leaves. There
is a peculiar effect produced by the way in which this
example is printed, and the lettering of the inscription
is also unusual.</p>

<p>There is one of these book-plates which the reader
should notice from the peculiar arrangement of the
decorative accessories, occasioned by the fact that
the owner was both a spiritual and temporal peer.
I refer to that of 'Nathanael Crewe, Lord Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of Durham and Baron Crewe of Stene, 1703.' Here
the mantling springs from the helmet, rises to the
level of the crest, and terminates at the heads of the
supporters; a baron's coronet appears instead of a
mitre, and behind the shield are a crozier and sword
in saltire, the decoration of the head of the crozier
being so like the form of the mantling that it seems,
at first sight, to be part of it.</p>

<p>The 'Jacobean' style is far more ornate than that
last mentioned, and the book-plate of 'John Reilly
of the Middle Temple, Esqr.,' is a fair example of
the best kind of Jacobean work. The escutcheon is
raised on an elaborate and richly-carved Jacobean
sideboard; mantling is still there, but it is curtailed,
and seems almost resting on the top of the sideboard,
on either side of which are columns, given in high
relief; on each is carved a perpendicular festoon of
leaves. Below the shield, crouched on the ledge of
the sideboard, are two eagles with expanded wings;
each holds in its beak one end of the ribbon which
ties into a bunch the corners of a fringed cloth
bearing the inscription already quoted; below the
eagles, inverted cornucopi&aelig; pour out books upon the
floor on which the sideboard stands.</p>

<p>This plate may probably be dated very early in the
eighteenth century, or even late in the seventeenth,
since it is recorded that John Reilly's signature,
with the date '1679,' occurs in a book in which it is
fastened. To whichever date it belongs, the Simple
Armorial style was then in general use,&mdash;that is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
say, so far as the book-plates of private individuals
are concerned. These, as we have just seen, nearly
all bear a helmet, varying according to the owner's
social rank, and from that falls the mantling, more
or less elaborate. But if we look at the book-plates,
dated in or about the year 1700, of certain colleges
at Oxford or Cambridge, at ladies' book-plates of the
same period,&mdash;none of which, of course, display a
helmet,&mdash;and at some others in which the arms are
given in an oval, we see that the blank on either side
of the shield (consequent upon the absence of the
helmet from which the mantling would fall) is
supplied by work distinctly Jacobean. Lord De
Tabley, whose descriptions in justification of the
names he has bestowed upon the several styles we
shall not hesitate to quote in this chapter, thus
describes this work:&mdash;</p>

<p>'To supply this void in decoration, a distinct frame
was placed round the escutcheons, and this framework
was ornamented with ribbons, palm branches,
or festoons.</p>

<p>'The prominent or high-relief portions of this frame
were not set close to the edges of the escutcheons,
but between it and them; an interval of flat-patterned
surface nearly always intervened, in which, as upon
a wall, the actual shield was embedded. This we
shall call the lining of the armorial frame; and we
shall find this lining is usually imbricated with a
pattern of fish-scales, one upon another, or diapered
into lattice-work. The scale-covered or latticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
interval of lining is the characteristic of the style....
Another step in the external decoration was to add
a bracket, distinct from the frame, upon which the
shield, in its frame, was supposed to rest. This
bracket naturally initiated the decorative art and
surface arrangement of the shield-frame.'</p>

<p>As a rule, too, an escallop-shell forms the centre
of the bracket in Jacobean book-plates. In some
instances it is placed in the centre below, but more
usually in the centre above; and then in the centre
below we have the head of some mythical and uninviting
monster. Either as quasi-supporters on the
ledges of the bracket, right and left, or on the side
ledges of the shield, if the bracket is amalgamated
with the frame, are 'things' selected from the
following miscellaneous collection&mdash;lions; cherubs,
male and female; term-figures; busts of fairies,
with butterfly wings; angels, generally engaged in
trumpet-blowing, etc.</p>

<p>The student should notice this escallop-shell,
because we shall see it introduced into the style
of decoration that succeeded the Jacobean&mdash;there
it became a shelly border rather than a distinct
shell.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, the usual ornamentation of a
Jacobean book-plate renders it easily recognisable.
The decoration is stiff and conventional, displays
more solidity than grace, and altogether seems less
appropriate to a book-plate than the heavy rolls of
mantling, which, as we have seen, surrounded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
shield during the prevalence of the preceding style.
As for the title 'Jacobean' which has been bestowed
upon it, it should be explained that the reference is
rather to the style of decoration in vogue in the days
of James <span class='small'>II.</span> than to anything in the days of James <span class='small'>I.</span>
Lord De Tabley has pointed out that, as compared
with the woodwork preserved in churches of the
latter half of the seventeenth century, and as compared
with the mouldings on monuments of the same
period, a practical identity of decoration cannot fail
to strike the antiquary, and his choice of the name
'Jacobean' for this class of book-plates is thus
abundantly justified.</p>

<p>Examples of Jacobean book-plates are numerous
in most English collections, for the style continued
long in fashion; indeed, it lasted, in more or less
purity, down to 1745, or even later, and I think it
quite likely that some of the evidently early undated
examples may really have been executed during
the last quarter of the seventeenth century. The
similarity, to which we have just alluded, between
the ornamentation shown upon Jacobean book-plates
and that displayed in ecclesiastical decoration
of the time of Charles the Second as well as
James the Second, makes it very probable that this
is so.</p>

<p>The few book-plates which are known to have
been designed or executed by Hogarth (see <a href="#Page_79">p. 79</a>)
are in the Jacobean style; but, with the exception
of that eminent artist and George Vertue, the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
who worked upon Jacobean book-plates were not
distinguished engravers. Nevertheless, some of their
productions are distinctly good, though the decoration
was, perhaps, too often overdone. The touch, in
many, suggests that the artist was accustomed to
engrave on gold or silver plate. This is notably the
case in the book-plate of 'Charles Barlow, Esq., of
Emmanuel College, Cambridge,' engraved in, or immediately
after, 1730. This book-plate is worthy
of observation, should the reader meet with it, as a
particularly exaggerated example of the Jacobean
style: the framework seems scarcely able to support
the decorative accessories with which it is laden,
and which include representations of birds, beasts,
mythical figures, stony flowers in festoons or baskets,
heads, shells, and what not!</p>

<p>The earliest dated Jacobean example is that of
'William Fitz Gerald, Lord Bishop of Clonfert,' which
is inscribed '1698.' Here the escutcheon is of the
'Simple Armorial' shape, but set in a Jacobean
framework, decorated with leafy sprays, and surmounted
by a mitre, the ribbons of which terminate
in tassels. Next we have the book-plates of five
Cambridge Colleges,&mdash;Jesus, Pembroke, Queens',
St. John's, and Trinity Hall; all bear the same
engraved date&mdash;1700. These, and many like them
dated in subsequent years, are no doubt the work
of one man: the design consists of an escutcheon,
on which are the College arms, set in a finely-drawn,
scale-patterned frame, bedecked with hawk-bells,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
ribbons, wreaths, and sprays of flowers. Other
College plates&mdash;except that of New College,
Oxford, which is 'Simple Armorial' in its style&mdash;are
Jacobean.</p>

<p>In 1701 comes the book-plate of Dame Anna
Margaretta Mason. Here the lozenge, in which she
bears her arms, appears with decoration very similar
to that just described, though slightly more elaborate.
In 1703 the book-plate of Philip Lynch shows how
similar decoration is bestowed upon an oval escutcheon;
whilst, in 1713, the book-plate of Henry, Duke of
Kent, furnishes an early dated example of the introduction
of the bracket, which is, as we have seen, a
leading feature in Jacobean ornamentation.</p>

<p>This is really a remarkably fine book-plate. The
escutcheon, indented in a somewhat peculiar fashion,
is surrounded by the Garter, and fastened to the
front of the bracket, a highly ornamented piece of
work, on which stand the two supporters. Above
is the ducal coronet; below, in an oblong Jacobean
frame, is the inscription. The family of Grey, Dukes
of Kent, is prolific in book-plates; that, dated five
years later, of 'Mary, Countess of Harrold,' daughter-in-law
to Henry, Duke of Kent, is a more elaborate,
though less finely executed, piece of Jacobean work.
Her arms, and those of her husband, appear side by
side in separate oval shields; angels hold aloft an
earl's coronet over both, while below, between the
shields, is the head of a cherub, whose wings are
arranged as a collar.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Other conspicuous Jacobean book-plates are those
of Ellerker Bradshaw; Dr. Philip Bisse, Bishop of St.
David's; Richard Massie of Coddington, Cheshire;
'James Hustler,' 1730; 'Sir Thomas Hare, Baronet,
of Stow Hall, in Norfolk,' dated in 1734 (see
<a href="#Page_61">p. 61</a>); 'Francis Winnington, of Lincoln's Inn, Esq.,'
dated in 1732; 'Saml. Goodford of ye Inner Temple,
Esq.,' dated in 1737; 'John Robinson, M.D.,' dated
in 1742; 'St. Thomas's Hospital Library;' and
'Lucius Henry Hibbins, of Gray's Inne, Esqe.'</p>

<p>A little before, and a little after, 1720 there was a
fashion in English book-plates, which may almost
be called a style: it was to place the shield of arms
in a medallion, the background of which is shaded.
Beneath, is the owner's name and description. The
term 'Tombstone Style' might not sound an agreeable
designation for these book-plates, but it would be
very accurate; for, really, there is a strong likeness
between them and the monumental slabs placed over
deceased persons, whose social status rendered them
eligible for interment in positions where they would
be walked over by future generations of church-goers.
We may mention three such book-plates: Edward
Haistwell, dated in 1718, Sir John Rushout and John
Lethieullier, Remembrancer of the City.</p>

<p>So far the shape of the shield used has been
perfectly symmetrical. We now come to speak of the
third style adopted by English book-plate designers,
the leading feature of which is an absence of
symmetry. This style has been christened 'Chippendale';<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and when its characteristics have been described,
and the leading features in Chippendale
furniture remembered, we shall see the appropriateness
of the name.</p>

<p>'The mark and stamp of a Chippendale <i>ex libris</i>,'
says Lord De Tabley, 'is a frilling or border of open
shell-work, set close up to the rounded outer margin
of the escutcheon, and, with breaks, more or less
enclosing it. This seems to be a modification of the
scallop shell, so normal at the base either of frame
or bracket on a Jacobean plate. It is, in fact, a
border imitating the pectinated curves and grooves
on the margins of a scallop-shell. Outside this
succeed various furniture-like limbs and flourishes,
eminently resembling the triumphs of ornate upholstery
which Chippendale about this time brought
into vogue.' The helmet and mantling are quite
exceptional in book-plates of this style, except in examples
which were probably designed and executed
by Scotch artists.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 449px;"><a id="HARE"></a>
<img src="images/i_077.jpg" width="449" height="550" alt="Hare's bookplate: Lion above shield" />
</div>

<p>Although it was not until 1754 that Chippendale
published, in folio, <i>The Gentleman's and Cabinetmaker's
Director</i>, 'being a large Collection of the
most useful Designs of Household Furniture in the
most fashionable taste, with 160 Plates of elegant
designed Furniture,' there was probably by that time
a good deal of Chippendale furniture already in the
market, and we are therefore not surprised to find a
book-plate designed in the Chippendale style, dated
in 1714&mdash;that of 'East Apthorpe.' True, the style<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a><br /><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
there shown is not at all 'advanced,' yet there
are decided indications of it, and for that reason
it deserves attention. Although the shield is shell-shaped
and ornamented with flowers, yet there are
upon the plate indications of a horizontally-hatched
Jacobean lining to the frame. We may, I think,
consider this one of the earliest attempts at designing
a Chippendale book-plate.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 286px;"><a id="BRACKSTONE"></a>
<img src="images/i_079.jpg" width="286" height="390" alt="Brackstone's Bookplate" />
</div>

<p>The style improved during the next ten or fifteen
years, and then began to deteriorate. As an escutcheon,
the shell-shaped or non-symmetrical shield
is unnatural and even ugly, but it lends itself to an
artistic treatment which the previous styles in English
book-plates certainly did not. For example,
flowers&mdash;of which there are always many in this style
of book-plate&mdash;can be represented as in nature; roses
blossom on sprays or branches, instead of being woven
closely together in conventional festoons, lilies are left
to droop their heads, whilst bunches of grasses or leaves
are bound so loosely together that they forfeit nothing
of their natural elegance. Allegoric figures also find
place in Chippendale book-plates, but they are of
a much more attractive kind than those displayed
in the Jacobean plates. Cupids or nymphs are sometimes
really graceful bits of drawing when depicted
in the better specimens of the style of which we are
now speaking. The book-plate of 'James Brackstone,
Citizen of London,' dated in 1751&mdash;figured
opposite this page&mdash;is as good a specimen of a pure
Chippendale book-plate as could be found; whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a><br /><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
that of John Ord of Lincoln Inn, dated ten years
later, betrays some signs of a decadence which soon
afterwards became general.</p>

<p>'The fashion,' as Lord De Tabley remarks, 'began
to be vulgarised in the hands of weak designers, who
bestowed floral embellishments upon the framework
of the shields, without any moderation whatever,
endeavouring by a crowded decoration to mask the
real weakness and poverty of their powers of design.'
As a consequence, we have in the later Chippendale
book-plates, those, say, from 1760 to 1780 or 1785, some
very terrible productions. Shell-work and flowers
are retained, but they are regarded as inadequate,
and cherubs, dragons, 'nymphs in kilted petticoats,'
sheep, cattle, trees, fruit, fruit-baskets, portions of
buildings, fountains, books, implements of husbandry,
and a host of other miscellaneous objects appear as
decorations. Indeed, it is wonderful what a strange
medley a designer in the later days of Chippendaleism
could produce for a customer willing to pay
for it!</p>

<p>We may as well here point out a few interesting
examples of English book-plates designed in
the Chippendale style. A prolific worker in it was
J. Skinner of Bath (see <a href="#Page_81">pp. 81-86</a>; <a href="#Page_203">203-212</a>), who
followed the excellent plan of dating nearly all his
work, which should, therefore, be carefully observed
when met with. In one of his book-plates, that which,
in 1743, he produced for 'Charles Delafaye, Esq., of
Wichbury, Wilts.' it is curious to note with what evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
diffidence the designer uses the graceful sprays of
natural flowers in ornamenting the shelly shield.
Yet in another book-plate, that of Benjamin Hatley
Foote, engraved in the same year, the anonymous
artist uses these ornaments without hesitation, and
produces a book-plate which might have been engraved
many years later. Two very noticeable examples
are also supplied by the fully developed Chippendale
book-plates of Richard Caryer and Joseph Pocklington.
In each the crest is placed on a miniature
representation of the shield, which contains the
arms. Of the debased Chippendale book-plates, of
which we have had to speak, it is hard to select
examples for particular reference, for they are sadly
numerous, and seem to vie with each other in ugliness
and vulgarity; the prize may, however, be claimed
by 'C. Eve', who, conscious, perhaps, of the atrocity
he was committing in using such a book-plate, makes
an attempt at disguising his name. To describe his
plate is nearly impossible; suffice it to say that,
built on to the frame are sundry stages on which a
variety of pastoral scenes are depicted, and that any
beauties which the floral embellishments might in
themselves possess are effectually obliterated by
overcrowding.</p>

<p>Before Chippendaleism had died out, another
marked style in English book-plates had already
come in, and was getting to be generally adopted.
We will call this the 'Wreath and Ribbon' or 'Festoon'
style, and probably one of the earliest examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of it is that figured opposite, which shows us
the book-plate of George Lewis Jones, Bishop of
Kilmore, dated in 1774. There is a good deal of
grace in these 'Wreath and Ribbon' book-plates.
The shield is again symmetrical, and of a shape that a
shield might possibly be; the flowers and leaves that
decorate it are for the most part still left free and
unconfined, and even when woven into festoons
they are somewhat less conventional than those
which compose the festoons of the Jacobean period.
These festoons, and a labyrinth of floating ribbons,
were intended to compensate for the loss of the
shelly border and its adjuncts of the 'Chippendale'
style.</p>

<p>Just in the same way as the Chippendale book-plates
very closely resembled in their decoration the
furniture with which Chippendale filled the fashionable
drawing-rooms of his time, so in their turn
those designed in what we have christened the
'Wreath and Ribbon' style very closely resembled
the decoration which Thomas Sheraton suggested
for contemporary furniture. This the reader may
see for himself, if he will turn to Sheraton's
work, <i>The Cabinetmaker and Upholsterer's Drawing
Book</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 291px;"><a id="KILMORE"></a>
<img src="images/i_083.jpg" width="291" height="400" alt="Kilmore's bookplate" />
</div>

<p>I do not know that there are many examples of
the 'Wreath and Ribbon' book-plates which call for
special attention. Though several are pretty, there is
a strong family likeness between all. Perhaps the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a><br /><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>most conspicuous is that of 'John Symons, Esq<sup>r</sup>.' In
this, prettily drawn cherubs, descending from the sky,
hold the corners of a mantle, which surrounds the
shield. The book-plates of 'Sir Thomas Banks
I'Anson, of Corfe Castle, Dorset'; of the 'Rev.
George Pollen'; and of 'John Holcombe, New
Cross,' are useful for comparison, on account of the
engraved dates which they bear&mdash;1783, 1787, and
1799 respectively; whilst that of 'Robert Surtees,
Mainsforth,' is interesting both from its possessor,
the historian of Durham, who was also its designer,
and from its unusual hatched background.</p>

<p>By degrees the festoons of flowers and entanglement
of ribbons were discarded, and the shield,
similarly shaped, appeared destitute of ornamentation.
The helmet was omitted, and the 'wreath' on which
the crest should properly rest was placed, in a
meaningless way, the fraction of an inch above the
upper line of the shield, and entirely without support.
After this, quite early in the nineteenth century, and
during its first fifteen or twenty years, there came
into fashion a design in English book-plates which
we may term the 'Celestial' style. In this the shield
is depicted as suspended in mid-air, with a background
of sky or clouds, or else resting upon a
cloud-built bank. It gave the designer very slight
opportunity for the display of artistic taste; had it
done so, the opportunity would probably have been
neglected, for the designers and engravers of book-plates
in this style were men of whom the world at
large knows nothing. The shield, in book-plates of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the time of which I am now speaking, was entirely
without ornament, and of this shape&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 107px;">
<img src="images/i_085.jpg" width="107" height="100" alt="blank shield" />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>The helmet was seldom introduced, so that the crest
was placed in the same absurd position as that just
described. The shield figured above is a fair specimen
of that in vogue between 1810 and 1830. From
the latter date to within a few years ago, the arms, in
the majority of English book-plates, were represented
in a more ornate shield. The helmet was reintroduced,
and from it fell a slight mantling, somewhat similar
to that which appears in our earliest examples. It is
hardly necessary to indicate any particular specimens
designed in these last-mentioned styles.</div>

<p>Before closing this chapter, I ought, perhaps, to
say a word about Scotch and Irish book-plates. It
cannot be said that in these there was ever a style
distinctively national. The style fashionable in
England at a particular time was also fashionable
in Scotland and in Ireland; yet there is a perceptible
difference in the way in which its details were carried
out, especially in Scotland. In Edinburgh there were
several book-plate engravers, and their work possesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
a characteristic touch;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the 'Simple Armorial'
style is rendered much more stiffly, and the shield is
often round. 'Jacobean' book-plates are very uncommon,
but the 'Chippendales' are an odd mixture
of that style as we know it in England and the
'Jacobean.' The presence of a helmet and mantling
in a 'Chippendale' book-plate engraved in Scotland
is not unusual, and the shield is always very soberly
placed. I do not know of a 'Library Interior' plate
that hails from north of the Tweed; but, if one
ever be discovered, depend upon it no Cupids will
frolic there. A few Scotch book-plates are, perhaps,
emblematic; that is, display emblems of the possessor's
art or trade. Dr. John Bosworth's, in which
are figured the staff of &AElig;sculapius, a cock, a serpent,
and an owl, is an instance of this; but allegory is
almost unknown. No mythological figures sit among
the floral decorations of Scotch Chippendale book-plates,
as they do so frequently in later Chippendale
work in England. The only instance that I can call
to mind of the introduction of figures at all into the
decoration of a Scotch book-plate, is that of 'Birnie
of Broomhill' (<i>circa</i> 1715), reproduced opposite, and
in this the figures are sombre enough,&mdash;two ministers
of 'the kirk' kneeling at their desks. Irish book-plates
have even less individuality than Scotch, and
are chiefly recognisable by the coarseness of their
work, and their dark printing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ALLEGORY IN ENGLISH BOOK-PLATES</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">In</span> the last chapter I spoke of the leading styles
followed in designing English book-plates, in, as far
as possible, chronological sequence, though the reader
will have noticed that such styles overlapped each
other, often by a considerable number of years.
Concurrently with these distinct styles, or with
nearly all of them, there are to be found many
English book-plates which may be appropriately
called 'picture' book-plates, and which may themselves
be divided into two classes: those which,
quite apart from the heraldry upon them, show
things unreal, or combinations of things real and
unreal; and those which, apart from the heraldry,
show things wholly real. Let us speak, first, of the
former of these divisions&mdash;'Allegoric' book-plates we
will call them.</div>

<p>The collector will soon discover that in England
allegory formed at no period, except, perhaps, in
the days of Bartolozzi and Sherwin, a really national
style in book-plates, but rather an occasional fancy
indulged in by a particular individual here and
there. Whilst in France book-plates on which was
displayed allegory, and the wildest allegory, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
actually abundant, in England they are decidedly
rare; and it is indeed interesting to see how our
English artists set to work when called upon to
design them.</p>

<p>So far as I am aware, the earliest example of an
English Allegoric book-plate as yet brought to
light, is that of Thomas Gore of Alderton, which
is fully described on <a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>. This may be dated
somewhere about 1675, and was, as the signature
shows us, the work of a Dutch artist, Michael
Burghers; so that we may, perhaps, regard the allegory
upon it rather as the outcome of Michael's brain
than the carrying out of instructions given him by a
Wiltshire squire!</p>

<p>The date of the next English book-plate I have
noticed, in which allegory is introduced, is also the
work of a foreigner,&mdash;a Frenchman,&mdash;Louis du
Guernier, who, at the age of thirty, came over from
Paris in 1708, and who died here in 1716. Soon
after his arrival he executed a book-plate, decidedly
foreign in appearance, for Lady Cairnes, wife of Sir
Alexander Cairnes of Monaghan. The Cairnes arms,
impaling Gould, are on a round shield in a scaly
frame; this is placed on steps, at the back of which
is classical masonry. The shield is kept from falling
by three cupids,&mdash;two seated and one standing,&mdash;whilst
two flying ones hold aloft a ribbon bearing
the owner's name, thus: 'Lady Elizabeth Cairnes.'
She was a sister of Sir Nathaniel Gould, so that her
description on the book-plate as 'Lady' is clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
wrong; she should have been called 'Dame.' The
error arose, most likely, from the engraver's imperfect
knowledge of English titles,&mdash;a very general
stumbling-block to foreigners. The book-plate is
an exceedingly pretty piece of work. There is some
of the Jacobean scale work used in it which English
engravers were beginning to introduce into their
designs; but the employment of allegory is certainly
the most striking feature it possesses. I do not
know of any other book-plates executed by Louis
du Guernier while in England, and probably the
people of this country were not yet quite prepared
to confide&mdash;as Lord De Tabley puts it&mdash;their family
escutcheons 'to the care of Minerva or the Delian
Ph&oelig;bus himself.'</p>

<p>But though Michael Burghers's somewhat unbeautiful
allegory may not have pleased Thomas Gore
or his other English clients in 1675, nor the prettier
allegory of Louis du Guernier have generally commended
itself to people in this country in 1710,
allegory, if not in the work of these artists, was bound
sooner or later to come into fashion on English book-plates,
seeing that it was, and for long had been,
fashionable across the Channel. There have been
few outbreaks of disease on the Continent that have
not infected this country,&mdash;at all events, slightly.
The foreigners whom the foreign king, on his arrival
in England in 1688, brought with him engendered
foreign ways and foreign fashions at Court, and these
ways and fashions were in turn adopted by people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
who did not go to Court, and that is how allegory
crept into the book-plates of the rank and file of
Englishmen.</p>

<p>The first English engraver, born and bred, to execute
an Allegoric book-plate was John Pine, himself a
man of letters, and one with whose features Hogarth
has made us familiar. In 1736 he was employed to
design and engrave a book-plate to place in the thirty
thousand volumes of Bishop Moore's library, which
George <span class='small'>I.</span> had bought, in 1715, to present to the
University of Cambridge, but which were not suitably
housed till 1734. No doubt Pine was fully impressed
with the munificence of the gift,&mdash;a mass of volumes
which the heavy-headed king would have never
opened had he kept, and never understood had he
opened them. His task was to design a book-plate
commensurate with the royal munificence, and he probably
considered he had been equal to the occasion
when he produced what we see opposite the next
page. Lord De Tabley's words so accurately describe
this pompous production, that I will quote them:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The design represents a vast structure, rather like
an ormolu chimney-piece clock, of which the arms
of the University of Cambridge, in a plain, solid
frame, represent the face. Behind this towers up a
vast pyramid, on which the brick work is distinctly
marked. As dexter supporter stands Ph&oelig;bus Apollo
in person, reaching out a wreath. A clouded sun
rays out behind him. At his feet are deposited
samples of the book collection of late so munificently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
bestowed. As sinister supporter sits Minerva with
helm and spear and Gorgon-headed shield. Her feet
are wrapt in cloud. In the centre of the bracket,
beneath these gods, is inserted a medallion portrait
of royal George, reading round its exergue, <i>Georgius
D.G., MAG. BR. FR. ET HIB. REX F.D.</i> This
is flanked by a laurel and a palm branch.' Pine&mdash;who
had submitted proofs of this book-plate before
August 1736, for at that date he offers to make
George's portrait more accurate&mdash;engraved four sizes
of this plate. The design is similar in three, but in
the fourth, and smallest, the artist evidently felt that,
in so limited a space, he could not do justice to
Apollo and Minerva, and discreetly omitted them.
He signs this smallest plate in full, 'J. Pine, Sculp.'</p>

<p>There may now be seen at Cambridge, in many
of the books which George <span class='small'>I.</span> presented, book-plates
which at first sight appear to be modern impressions
from Pine's plates, but, on examination, prove to be
copies, though not exact copies, of Pine's work, and
on these the signature is 'J. B.' The late Mr. Henry
Bradshaw discovered that these copies were the work
of John Baldrey, a Cambridge engraver, at the close
of the last century. At the time that he was working
for the University, a large number of the volumes
given by George <span class='small'>I.</span> required re-binding, and, as Pine's
plates were worn out or lost, Baldrey was commissioned
to execute a copy of the earlier design,
in order to supply a book-plate for the re-bound
volumes.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Very soon after the 'Munificentia Regia' to Cambridge
in 1715, the loyalty of Oxford to the 'illustrious
House of Hanover' was seriously doubted,
and the King sent a squadron of horse into the city,
whereupon an Oxford 'varsity wit composed the
following epigram:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
'The King, observing with judicious eyes,<br />

</div>

<p>Though much later in date than the design just
noticed, it may be as well to mention here another
book-plate&mdash;also 'Allegoric'&mdash;which, was
engraved by John Pine. This was executed by him
from a drawing by Gravelot, for Dr. John Burton,
about the year 1740. It shows us the interior of a
library, presumably the doctor's, with a couple of
cupids supporting a shield bearing the Burton arms.
This design, which was subsequently appropriated
by 'Wadham Wyndham, Esq.,' as his book-plate,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> is
a very 'slight' affair after the Cambridge plate; but
Pine no doubt possessed a fitting sense of the difference
to be observed in designing a book-plate for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
mere Doctor of Divinity and in commemorating the
gift of a royal donor.</p>

<p>After John Pine, the next designers of English
book-plates in the Allegoric style are both famous
men,&mdash;William Hogarth and George Vertue. We
will speak of the works of the greater man first:
they consist of two undoubted book-plates and of a
few more possible ones, and were executed quite at
the outset of Hogarth's career, say, about 1720. The
first is described as done for the books of John
Holland, herald painter. Minerva is seen seated
among cupids, four in number, with her hand placed
upon a shield bearing the family arms. The chief
interest in Hogarth's other undoubted book-plate&mdash;that
of George Lambart, the landscape painter, one
of Hogarth's convivial crew&mdash;lies in the female figures,
which sit right and left of the shield. It is figured
over leaf, from the copy in Sir Wollaston Franks's
collection, which is the only original example known
to exist&mdash;other copies are from the plates in Ireland's
work, and bear his initials. The collector is cautioned
against certain plates signed 'W. H.,' which have
been attributed to Hogarth, but are in reality the
work of William Hibbart, a Bath engraver, working
about the middle of the eighteenth century.</p>

<img src="images/i_096.jpg" width="409" height="390" alt="Lambart's bookplate" />
</div>

<p>Turning now to the work of George Vertue in
designing English Allegoric book-plates, we come to
a very beautiful and very interesting example, which
was probably engraved in, or very soon after, 1730&mdash;the
book-plate of Henrietta, Countess of Oxford. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a><br /><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
have already called attention to this engraving in
speaking of old-time allusions to book-plates (<a href="#Page_14">p. 14</a>),
and do not here intend to do more than make passing
reference to it, since I have spoken fully of it later
on in what I have to say about 'ladies'' book-plates
(<a href="#Page_186">pp. 186-199</a>). It is only mentioned now in order to give
a reference to it in its proper chronological position.</p>

<p>We have now to travel for some distance along the
road of time before coming to another example of
allegory on an English book-plate.</p>

<p>We find it, in 1740, on a plate which one J. Skinner
engraved from a design by 'T. Ross.' This is really a
very beautiful book-plate, as its reproduction (<a href="#Page_83">p. 83</a>)
shows. A shield&mdash;the shape and ornamentation of
which is Chippendale&mdash;bearing the Wiltshire arms, is
placed upon a platform and against a cippus, or small
monumental column; Shakespeare stands on the right,
and listens, with a pleased expression, to the music
of a rustic piper, whose head appears at the back
of the cippus, whilst, on the left, Pope weighs the
eloquence of an orator, whose head and upraised hand
also appear from behind the cippus. A medallion
of Augustus is on a pedestal above. Lying on the
platform are a globe and books and many emblems of
the painter's and musician's arts, and amongst these
sits Cupid thinking, perhaps, with which he will play
next, and holding the end of a ribbon inscribed:
'John Wiltshire, Bath, 1740.' The design is certainly
original, and makes us interested as to the identity
of the owner.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>It is quite possible that we have here not only
an interesting book-plate, but the book-plate of an
interesting man. When Gainsborough, the painter,
moved to Bath in 1760 he found that the 'Pickford'
of the day, who had the carrying trade of the
Bath road, was no ordinary carrier, but a man of
taste and culture, and ready to do anything he could
to help art and artists. He was a certain John
Wiltshire, and before Gainsborough had been long
a resident at Bath he was Wiltshire's fast friend, and
in the enjoyment of a very tangible proof of friendship:
for Wiltshire carried to London, <i>gratis</i>, every
picture that Gainsborough needed to send thither.
Not a penny would he take for carriage. 'No,
no,' he would say, when the painter's modesty
led him to protest against such generosity, 'I
admire painting too much for that.' No doubt
he did, and it must be said that, in return for
his goodness, Gainsborough gave him many a
charming bit of work on which to feast his eyes.
Let us hope we have before us the book-plate of
this 'kind of worthy man,' as Allan Cunningham
called him, who loved Gainsborough and admired
his works.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 458px;"><a id="WILTSHIRE"></a>
<img src="images/i_099.jpg" width="458" height="600" alt="Wiltshire's bookplate" />
</div>

<p>Of course the plate is twenty years earlier than the
commencement of Gainsborough's residence at Bath
and of his friendship with Wiltshire; but what of
that? Wiltshire had been, likely enough, a lover of
things beautiful and the owner of books, long before;
there is no necessity for imagining that his was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a><br /><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
sudden conversion to a self-sacrificing love for art,
produced by intimacy with Gainsborough.</p>

<p>Another interesting English book-plate, in which
allegory plays a part, is that, also by J. Skinner, of
William Oliver,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> doctor of medicine, philanthropist,
and inventor of biscuits. It is, judging from the
form of the engraver's signature, of about the same
date as the Wiltshire book-plate. The shield, bearing
the Oliver coat-of-arms, rests upon a platform on
which stand two figures, as in the example last
described; but instead of these figures being representative
of the drama and of literature, they are
an ancient and a modern medical practitioner: the
former, perhaps, even the god of medicine himself.
This was quite appropriate, for Oliver, though a man
of cultured tastes in varied walks of life, and one who
might have appropriately committed the care of his
family escutcheon to the allegoric representatives of
many arts, was first and foremost a doctor of medicine.
The modern doctor is arrayed in cap and gown, and
stands on the left of the shield, with hand outstretched
towards his fellow of old time. Below the
platform, on a triangle, is a club, around which the
serpent of &AElig;sculapius entwines itself.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 385px;"><a id="OLIVER"></a>
<img src="images/i_101.jpg" width="385" height="499" alt="Oliver's bookplate" />
</div>

<p>Oliver's life lasted for hard on seventy years&mdash;1695
to 1764; after settling at Bath and commencing
practice, his rise to fame was remarkable for its
rapidity, and, as quite early in his career he busied
himself with hospital building, hospital management,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a><br /><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and other good works, he soon made for himself a
number of enemies amongst his fellow-practitioners
less capable and less energetic than himself. As a
physician and philanthropist he is now forgotten; as
the inventor of a biscuit he is remembered&mdash;for the
'Bath Oliver' still holds its own against the multitude
of modern competitors, and is still&mdash;so the makers
say&mdash;prepared from Dr. Oliver's original receipt.
That receipt he confided, when on his death-bed, to
his coachman, giving him &pound;100 in money and ten
sacks of the finest flour wherewith to continue the production
of the then already popular biscuits. With the
money the coachman opened a shop in Green Street,
Bath, and so got together a comfortable fortune. Of
Skinner, to whom we owe these two plates, we shall
have more to say presently (<a href="#Page_203">pp. 203-212</a>), in referring
to the engravers of English book-plates.</p>

<p>Ten years after the Wiltshire plate comes our
next distinctly Allegoric book-plate, engraved by a
second-rate engraver for 'John Duick.' I have not
seen this plate, but Lord De Tabley, whose word-pictures
are always good, thus describes it:&mdash;'Apollo
with a broad ray effect round his head, playing the
lyre to the nine Muses, who are grouped around
him; the musical ones also assist in the concert with
various instruments. Below are clouds, above them
appear the abrupt cliffs of Helicon, with Pegasus
launching himself into the air therefrom; the fountain
Hippocrene, tapped by his galloping hoofs, descends
the cliff-side in a cascade.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Allegory also appears in the two book-plates
engraved by Sir Robert Strange about the middle
of the eighteenth century; those of his brother-in-law,
Andrew Lumisden, secretary to Prince Charlie,
and of a Dr. Thomas Drummond. The circumstances
under which the former was engraved have been
already referred to (<a href="#Page_11">p. 11</a>). It is a sombre book-plate,
showing us, before a dark background, a slab with a
bust at either end; 'Cupid' plays on the ground
before the centre of the slab; the Lumisden arms
are on a shield that lies in the left-hand corner; and
a heavy curtain hangs over the upper part of the
design, which is signed '<i>R. Strange, sculpt.</i>'</p>

<p>Dr. Drummond's book-plate (see <a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>) is a less
heavy, but not so finished a production, and is
drawn by T. Wale: Aurora soars at the top of
the design, and with her left hand pulls aside a
curtain, thus disclosing a view of the doctor's library.
In the centre is placed a table covered with cloth,
except at the right-hand corner; here the drapery
is raised so as to display the ornate workmanship
of the table-leg. On the cloth are a number
of books, some music, and a flute; before the table
a globe, and, leaning against that, a violoncello.
The general decoration of the room is classical, and
busts and statues are introduced, though not with
sufficient detail to be recognisable. In Aurora's
right hand is a flaming torch, held in dangerous
proximity to the curtain.</p>

<p>After the date of these two plates comes another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
long interval&mdash;twenty years or so&mdash;before we reach
the next truly Allegoric book-plate designed in England.
We then find a decidedly graceful piece of
work. A hooded Sibyl, seated at the foot of a
pyramid, peruses attentively an open volume. She
leans her cheek upon her right hand, whilst the left
rests upon the book. A caduceus, against which
rests a shield of arms, lies at her feet. The whole
is contained in an oval wreath of berried laurel.
Below is written: 'E libris Joh&#299;s Currer de Kildwick,
Arm.' This book-plate was afterwards altered for
'Danson Richardson Currer, de Gledston, Arm&#772;,' and
an inferior copy was used by a certain R. H. Alexander
Bennet; this is a much commoner book-plate
than the Currer&mdash;in either form.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 377px;"><a id="DRUMMOND"></a>
<img src="images/i_105.jpg" width="377" height="500" alt="DRUMMOND'S BOOK-PLATE" />
</div>

<p>Of much the same date is the far less graceful
representation of allegory, which appears on the
book-plate of 'T. Gascoigne, Parlington, in Yorkshire.'
Here we have a representation of what, we must
presume, is the interior of the Parlington Library; but
neither 'T. Gascoigne,' nor yet any other eighteenth
century Yorkshire gentleman, is tasting the sweets of
his literary collection; the library is tenanted by a
couple of mythological females, of such substantial
forms that Lord De Tabley thinks they must represent
two Yorkshire damsels masquerading, one as a
muse and the other as Apollo. The muse writes
down either notes or words from Apollo's dictation.
Columns support the roof of the library, and in a
niche in the wall stands a small statue of Minerva. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a><br /><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Mr. Gascoigne obtained the services of some Yorkshire
relatives to stand as models for the figures on
his book-plate, he probably did so when they were
in town for the season, for the work is signed by a
Bond Street engraver.</p>

<p>About the year 1775, English Allegoric book-plates
became more numerous, and the allegory upon them
assumes a grace in conception and execution not
before known. Cipriani, Bartolozzi, and his pupil
Sherwin, were showing Englishmen how allegory
could be represented on book-plates without being
clumsy and ridiculous, and the lesser artists were
imitating their work with more or less success.</p>

<p>One of Bartolozzi's earliest book-plates was executed
for Sir Foster Cunliffe, Bart., the descendant
of a very famous Liverpool merchant. The Cunliffe
arms appear in mid-air, resting upon a bank of
clouds; two exquisitely drawn cherubs support the
shield, over which is folded drapery. The cherub on
the dexter side is seated, and holds a caduceus in
his right hand. The one on the sinister side is furnished
with two trumpets, and is blowing that in his
left hand. On a medallion above the shield is the
Cunliffe crest, with the motto <i>Fideliter</i>. The plate,
which was afterwards altered for Sir Robert H.
Cunliffe, Bart., is, in all probability, Cipriani's design,
for that artist signs his name as designer of an
almost similar book-plate for Jean Tommins, which
was engraved by Ford several years before. A very
coarse imitation of the design was also used by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Thomas Anson of Shughborough, who intrusted the
imitation to Yates.</p>

<p>Sir Foster Cunliffe was a grandson of Foster
Cunliffe, King Charles the Second's godson, the
Liverpool merchant, who, according to Foster's <i>Lancashire
Families</i>, 'became not only the first man in
Liverpool, but was supposed to have a more extended
commerce than any merchant in the kingdom, and
declined all solicitations that he should represent
Liverpool in Parliament.'</p>

<p>The remarkably large example of Bartolozzi's work
which has often been described as the book-plate of
George <span class='small'>III.</span>, does not appear ever to have been used
as such. In the previous edition of this book I alluded
to it (at <a href="#Page_67">p. 67</a>) as, possibly, a gift to the King, in
which, at the expense of utility, Bartolozzi sought to
display his gratitude to, and admiration for, the
sovereign, under whom he had come to reside; it
does not, however, seem that Bartolozzi intended the
engraving for a book-plate at all, but designed it for
the title-page of a folio volume, issued in 1792, which
contained engravings of thirty-six statesmen of the
reign of Henry <span class='small'>VIII.</span>, from drawings by Holbein. I
will give a short description of the engraving in
question, so that it may be more easily recognised
by the collector, if offered to him as a book-plate. It
shows us the arms of England, as borne by George
<span class='small'>III.</span>, prior to the Union with Ireland, upheld in mid-air
by three inhabitants of the skies. Above the
shield a fourth celestial being is flying, and at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
same time holding aloft His Majesty's crown. On
the left side of the plate is the figure of Fame, who,
on a long trumpet placed to her lips, is evidently
giving a sonorous blast. This is perhaps the most
uncomfortable part of the design, for the whole
weight of this somewhat massive young lady is
upon the shield, which we have said is in mid-air,
and only supported by three cherubs, whose united
muscular powers strike one as totally inadequate to
bear the burden imposed upon them.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 450px;"><a id="BESSBOROUGH"></a>
<img src="images/i_109.jpg" width="450" height="396" alt="Bessborough's" />
</div>

<p>In 1796, Bartolozzi, then a Royal Academician,
executed his most beautiful book-plate. It is inscribed
'H. F. Bessborough,' and was made for Lady
Henrietta Frances Spencer, who, in 1780, married
Frederick, third Earl of Bessborough. The design
shows us a Roman interior with an exquisitely drawn
Venus, seated, and holding in her left hand&mdash;which is
uplifted&mdash;a burning human heart, and in her right, a
dove. Behind her is a vase of flowers. The other
inmates of the room are two cupids, who hold above
the goddess a long scarf bearing Lady Bessborough's
name. The design is Cipriani's. Besides his signature
and that of the engraver, there is also on the
book-plate, 'Published Dec. 30, 1796, by F. Bartolozzi.'
It will be remembered that in 1735 Hogarth,
by his own exertions on behalf of his brother artists,
managed to get an Act through Parliament&mdash;a body
that then probably cared little for art or artists&mdash;by
which designers and engravers obtained a copyright
in their own works; and it is a singular testimony to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a><br /><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the popularity of Bartolozzi's work, that on so trivial
a work as a book-plate it was found necessary to
adopt this formula of publication. By the kindness
of the Hon. Gerald Ponsonby, I am enabled to state
that Bartolozzi's receipt for this 'ticket plate,' as he
calls it, bears as its date the 29th December 1796, the
day before the date of 'publication.' It is noteworthy
that Bartolozzi received &pound;20 for his work.
The book-plate is given on the previous page.</p>

<p>Quite distinct from this 'joyous' book-plate is
another, executed by the same artist for a Spanish
lady, which we may class as English, since it was
no doubt engraved by him in England. Isabel
de Menezes, the lady for whom this book-plate was
designed, was, as she tells us on it, in the seventy-first
year of her age. Allegoric figures disporting themselves
in youthful frolic would, perhaps, have been
out of keeping on the book-plate of a lady at that
sombre time of life, and so the designer has run to
the other extreme. Gloominess predominates in this
book-plate. A partly ruined square-built tomb is
erected on a promontory above the sea; briars and
other creepers have grown round it and had covered
it, till the kneeling female figure drew them down in
order to place upon the tomb a commemorative
inscription. Beside the figure is a Cupid, who points
to the newly-cut words. It has been thought that
this may have been designed for a visiting card; it is
quite in the fashion of such things at the date, and it
is likely enough that Isabel de Menezes used the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
plate both as a card and as a mark of ownership for
her books.</p>

<p>There are, besides those described, a number of
English book-plates which in style much resemble
Bartolozzi's work. If they are his, they probably
date before 1796, for the adoption of the publication
formula, before noticed, makes it improbable that
he executed any work, whilst in England, that he
did not thus protect. After his departure from this
country, he produced, from a drawing by Signeira,
a book-plate for Sir Thomas Gage, Bart., of Hengrave
Hall, Suffolk. In this, a female figure sits
upon a stone, against which is a plain shield bearing
the Gage arms. The plate is signed 'Bartolozzi,
Lisbon, 1805.' There is a distinct resemblance in
this book-plate to that which was engraved, either in
1786 or 1787, for Richard Hoare, eldest son of the
Lord Mayor of London. He was created a baronet
in the former year, and died in the latter. In this
we have a seated female, classically draped, who rests
her left elbow on a cippus, on which is engraved a
shield bearing the arms of Hoare. Richard Hoare
married the heiress of Stourhead, and his son was
Sir Richard Colt Hoare, the famous antiquary and
author. The date at which this plate must have been
executed, 1786 or 1787, does not allow the absence
of the engraver's name and formula of publication to
tell against the work being Bartolozzi's; his fame was
not then so great, and he found it less necessary to
protect his engravings from piracy (see <a href="#Page_197">p. 197</a>).</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Beautiful as are Bartolozzi's book-plates, it cannot
be said that his capabilities as a designer or an
engraver are demonstrated in these; works of a larger
kind showed forth his talents far more.</p>

<p>So, then, allegory at length came to be almost
popular with English book-plate owners, and various
lesser artists&mdash;Henshaw, Roe, Pollard, and some
others&mdash;produced it in imitation of Bartolozzi, with
only indifferent success. But before ending this
chapter, we must say something about the book-plate
work of Bartolozzi's chief English pupil, John Keys
Sherwin. In 1773, the year after he gained the
Royal Academy's gold medal for drawing, he executed
an extremely pretty Allegoric book-plate
for John Mitford of Pitt's Hill. It represents an
infant Neptune, with his trident, seated on a large
shell, which is upon the back of a sea-horse. Young
Neptune's drapery forms a graceful canopy, and he
supports in his right hand a small shell, which displays
the Mitford arms and crest. A dolphin, spouting
water in fountain-like sprays, swims by his side.
There are two states of this plate, one having the
arms incorrectly shaded: both are signed by Sherwin.</p>

<p>In closing our remarks on English book-plates,
designed after this fashion, notice&mdash;though only a
passing one, for it is spoken of fully later on&mdash;must
be taken of the charming book-plate which Agnes
Berry designed in 1793 for her friend Mrs. Damer. I
mention it here only to associate it in the reader's
mind with 'Allegoric' book-plates.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>So much for allegory on English book-plates. It is
to the credit of Englishmen that Allegoric work did
not become popular until something really artistic in
this particular style was produced, and that, even
before that time, allegory never ran quite so wild
on English book-plates as it did on foreign examples.
M. Poulet Malassis assures us that into one French
book-plate of the last century were crowded the whole
<i>personnel</i> of Olympus!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ENGLISH 'PICTURE' BOOK-PLATES</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">In</span> turning now to consider English book-plates
which show us, apart from the heraldry upon them,
things wholly real, we find much that is interesting.
First, we have 'Portrait' book-plates, those which,
either combined with heraldry or entirely without
it, show us the features of the owner of the volume.
There are but few of such book-plates, but they
are so interesting that we shall speak of them by
themselves later on (<a href="#Page_216">pp. 216-220</a>); they are common
to all periods, and the fashion of using them has
increased lately.</div>

<p>Then we have book-plates in which books themselves&mdash;book
piles or book shelves&mdash;are the predominating
feature in the design; with these, Sir
Arthur Vicars, in the pages of the <i>Ex Libris Journal</i>,
has dealt exhaustively. Though the book-plates which
show us library interiors would seem naturally to
come into this class of examples, I have been
forced to except the majority of them, and to speak
of them in the previous chapter, as being in nearly
every case at least tinged with allegory. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
in the <i>sanctum</i> of a doctor of divinity, Cupid frolics
about as happy, and as busy, as in a maiden's
boudoir. Still there are a few 'Library Interiors'
entirely free from allegory. Take, for instance, the
book-plate of Sir Robert Cunliffe. Here we have
the interior of a library with a window to the right.
Every ornament is thoroughly 'Chippendale' in
character; the legs of the table, the cartouche (which
contains the name), the shield, and the woodwork
surrounding the window. On the table is a globe,
upon a stand, the supports of which terminate in
Chippendale scrolls, an inkstand with a pen on it,
and two books, one closed, and the other open.
There are numbers of books confusedly disposed on
the shelves, the ceiling of the room is plain, and there
is only a plain line for a cornice. The arms occupy
the centre of the plate, and appear to be suspended in
mid-air, the foot of one of the scrolls only resting on
the table.</p>

<p>Again, the book-plates of 'The Manchester Subscription
Library,' 'The Manchester Circulating
Library,' and 'The Rochdale Circulating Library'
all show interiors of libraries, but free from allegoric
inmates. These three book-plates are nearly identical.
There are shelves of books at the sides, a tiled
floor, a table in the foreground, a panelled ceiling
with a cornice; and, at the end of the room, perhaps
a passage. There is a round arch containing a window
of three lights, the centre one having a round top.
The general appearance of the room is classical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Very similar is the book-plate of the Liverpool
Library. Here we have a complicated Chippendale
bookcase, with ten columns upon square bases, and
ornamental capitals of no particular style. The
shelves are filled with books, and the two central
divisions of the bookcase are all cupboards. In the
centre of the case, among Chippendale scrolls, is the
crest of the town, and below the central division of
the bookcase are the words 'Liverpool Library' in
two lines. Below the whole is a large cartouche, in
the same style as the rest of the plate, inscribed,
'Allowed for reading .... days. Forfeiture, ... d.
per day.' Mr. J. Paul Rylands, in his interesting <i>Notes
on Book-Plates</i>, tells us that this library, now the
Lyceum, was founded on the 1st of May 1758; the
book-plate was, no doubt, engraved soon afterwards,
as all the ornamentation introduced is certainly
'Chippendale.' So, too, is that on the book-plate
engraved by John Pine in 1750, which the Benchers
of Gray's Inn used for their volumes. Here a shell-shaped
shield, bearing the arms of the 'Learned and
Honourable Society,' is apparently fastened on to a
background of book-shelves filled with books. So
much for the 'Library Interiors.' The arrangement
of the volumes in the other book-plates in
which books form the chief feature of decoration,
is generally like that shown opposite in
the book-plate of William Hewer, a Commissioner
of the Navy, and the friend and secretary of
Samuel Pepys. How the scroll, on which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a><br /><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
either the owner's arms or his name, is supported,
is not clear.</p>

</div>

<p>The book-plate of Sir Philip Sydenham, dated
1699, when he was, as he tells us, twenty-three years
of age, offers another interesting example of the
Book-Pile design; Sir Philip shows us his coat
of arms on the face of the scroll, on the lower
roll of which, in very small letters, is written the
inscription. Apparently neither this nor any of his
other book-plates completely satisfied him, for during
the remaining forty years of his life he had more
than half-a-dozen different plates designed, and nearly
all of these are found in various 'states.' There are,
Mr. Fincham tells me, some sixteen varieties of
Sir Philip's book-plate; many of his books are now
in Sion College Library. In the book-plate of White
Kennett, who filled the See of Peterborough from
1718 to 1728, we see how the emblems of episcopacy
are treated when introduced into book-plates of this
type. White Kennett had other book-plates; the
rarest and earliest, engraved when he was at college,
is in the 'Simple Armorial' style. These 'Book-Pile'
plates appear at intervals down to the close of the
century, and the style has been recently revived
by book-plate designers; it is simple and certainly
appropriate. The approximate date of each example
may be generally gathered from the shape of the
shield containing the arms, or the style of decoration
around it.</p>

<p>We have yet to speak of by far the most numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
class of those English book-plates, which may
be properly brought into our second division of
'Picture' book-plates&mdash;I mean the examples which
represent upon them a landscape, either real or
imaginary. The real landscapes represented have,
of course, some direct reference to the plate; being a
view, either of the owner's house, his park, his parish
church, his town or village, of some particular spot in
the immediate vicinity of his residence, or of some
incident connected with his career or occupation&mdash;be
it business, profession, or pleasure. For instance,
Horace Walpole, in one of his book-plates, shows
us a view of his 'Palace of Varieties' at Strawberry
Hill (see <a href="#Page_106">p. 106</a>). Again, Thomas Gosden, the
angler sportsman and collector of angling literature,
introduces into his book-plate all sorts of
angling and sporting gear, even to a capacious
whisky flask. 'The Hon<sup>ble</sup> Robert Henry Southwell,
Lieut. 1st Regiment of Horse, 1767,' flanks
his shield with various kinds of military weapons
and trophies; whilst 'Captain William Locker,
Royal Navy,' shows us the swelling bosom of a
man-of-war 'foretop gallant' sail, on which is figured
his coat of arms.</p>

<p>We will speak first of those book-plates on which
the landscape is real, and we will call them 'View'
plates. Probably the earliest of these is the very
interesting one (see <a href="#Page_105">p. 105</a>), which was engraved
by Mynde about 1770 for the Library of the Public
Record Office, then in the Tower of London; here we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
have a remarkably faithful representation of the historic
building. The date at which the Tower book-plate
was probably engraved adds to its interest. Plates in
this style hardly appear at all before 1778 or 1780,
and do not become common till five or six years
later.</p>

<p>The book-plate of 'Peter Muilman of King S<sup>t.</sup>,
London, and Kirby Hall, Castle Hedingham, Essex,'
is one which, I think, may be classed among 'View'
plates, since the ruins depicted on it have certainly
the appearance of having been sketched from the
remains of some feudal stronghold, perhaps from
Castle Hedingham itself. In front of the ruins is
a wooded lawn, on which two robust cupids are
wrestling for the Muilman escutcheon. Kirby Hall
is not shown: no doubt this was a comfortable
Georgian house round the corner, where Peter and
his family spent their summer holidays away from
the bustle and smoke of King Street. Presumably,
the ruins of the castle were left standing in the park
for ornament's sake, to give a tone of feudalism to
the Muilman domain, whose owner, save by his
book-plate, is not known to fame. The plate was
engraved by Terry of Paternoster Row, probably
about 1775, so that this again is an early example
of its kind.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 413px;"><a id="TOWER"></a>
<img src="images/i_121.jpg" width="413" height="600" alt="Record  office in the tower of London" />
</div>

<p>Among other notable specimens of these 'View'
book-plates may be mentioned that which Pye, a
Birmingham engraver, executed for 'T. W. Greene'
of Lichfield. Here we have an oval-shaped shield,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a><br /><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
bearing the arms of Greene, resting against a tree-stump.
In the distance is a river, and Lichfield
Cathedral. Later on, Pye engraved a very similar
book-plate for another Lichfield man&mdash;an attorney
named Nicholson, who went to live at Stockport.
This shows Nicholson's residence on the margin of a
sheet of water. The arms rest against a shattered
oak-tree. A local view&mdash;one of Darlington&mdash;also
appears on the book-plate of George Allen, who
describes himself as of that town.</p>

<p>Collectors are wont to reckon as the most interesting
example of a view book-plate the vignette of
Horace Walpole's house at Strawberry Hill, with his
arms hanging on a shield from a withered tree. Mr.
Wheatley, however, who is inclined to attribute the
design to Walpole's friend, Bentley, has suggested
(<i>Bibliographica</i>, vol. iii. p. 88) that the vignette was
never used as a book-plate, but was exclusively
reserved as a kind of printer's device for the adornment
of the books printed at the Strawberry Hill
Press. Sir Wollaston Franks has four varieties of
the vignette, one engraved on wood and three on
copper; and I have certainly seen at least one of
them doing duty as a book-plate, but whether rightfully
or not it is impossible to say.</p>

<p>Modern examples of View book-plates were, till
quite recently, rare. One of the quaintest is furnished
by that used by the late Dr. Kendrick of
Warrington, and engraved for him in 1855; here we
have a view of the doctor's town as it was in 1783<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and a picture of a 'loyal Warrington Volunteer'
of 1798. Quite a useful historical print!</p>

<p>Now let me say a word about the Picture book-plates
on which the landscape is a fancy one.
Prominent amongst these is that of 'Gilbert Wakefield,'
which shows us a pretty scene: a stag stoops
to drink from a rivulet that trickles through a wood.
Very much later in date is a charming vignette,
representing a rock, over which a stream of water
trickles and sparkles as it falls into a pool below.
Ferns and flags grow in the pool. The book-plate
belonged to Joseph Priestley, and on that account we
mention it after Wakefield's. Priestley was quite
as bitter a Dissenter and as ardent a controversialist
as Gilbert Wakefield, though it is more as a
man of science that most people remember him. His
name is so intimately associated with Birmingham
politics at the time of the French Revolution, that
the fact of his book-plate being engraved by a Birmingham
man&mdash;it is signed 'Allen sct. Birming<sup>m</sup>'&mdash;becomes
the more interesting, and enables us to assign
the engraving to a marked period in the owner's life&mdash;the
time when his friendship with Lord Shelburne
began to cool, and when, settling down at Birmingham,
he began work on his <i>History of the Corruptions of
Christianity</i>. James Yates, who edited Priestley's
collected works, used the same book-plate, after
altering the name upon it.</p>

<p>Another delightfully rural scene is depicted on the
book-plate of 'John Hews Bransby.' His motto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
reads, <i>Breve et irreparabile tempus;</i> and he shows a
rustic landscape, in which the figures represented
have evidently learnt the truth of the assertion. The
sower scatters seed, the ploughboy is engaged with
his team,&mdash;all are making the most of their time,
yet there is no sign of hurry or bustle. The day
is fine, but clouds hover in the sky. On the left,
a cottage nestles in the trees, and the smoke from
its chimney tells of the housewife within preparing
a meal for those who are earning it by their labour
without.</p>

<p>So much for landscapes having direct reference to
the book-plates on which they appear. Often, however,
the landscape is purely a fancy one, as that on
the book-plate of Gregory Louis Way. A river
flows through fields, and beside it sits an armour-coated
knight, who is either wearied with the fight,
or bowed down by the fickleness of his lady.
His shield rests beside him, and on it are depicted
the arms of Way. The moon sheds upon the scene
what light she is able, but the sky is overcast and
stormy.</p>

<p>I must not close this chapter without reference to
the book-plates produced by Thomas Bewick, many of
which are familiar enough&mdash;as examples of Bewick's
art&mdash;to those who know little about book-plates,
and do not collect them. His are certainly for the
most part 'Landscape' plates; but I do not know
whether to class them with these examples of 'View'
book-plates, or with those which I have christened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
'Fancy Landscapes.' They were chiefly engraved for
northern book-owners, but one can hardly say that the
particular bit of scenery on each&mdash;though, doubtless,
in most cases drawn from nature&mdash;has any special
applicability to the owner. I will therefore speak
here of Bewick's book-plates as forming a class by
themselves. His first was prepared for Thomas Bell,
and is dated 1797, so that it is inaccurate to speak of
Bewick as the originator of the Landscape style in
book-plates; he found the style already followed
by many engravers, and his taste and skill brought
it to perfection. The Bell plate is not uncommon, as
the books for which it was engraved were sold in
1860. It shows, in the foreground of a landscape,
an oval shield, inscribed 'T. Bell, 1797,' and resting
against a decayed tree. In the distance are trees,
and above them rises the tower of St. Nicholas's
Church, in Newcastle&mdash;a favourite object with Bewick.
It is also introduced by Ralph Beilby into the book-plate
of Brand, the antiquary.</p>

<p>Out of the hundred or so book-plates designed or
engraved by Bewick, it is difficult to know which
to select for comment; but from the interest which
attaches to its owner, that of Robert Southey
(figured on <a href="#Page_111">p. 111</a>) suggests itself. Here we
have a rock, thickly crowned with shrubbery,
from which a stream of water falls into a brook
below. Against the face of the rock leans an
armorial shield, bearing the Southey arms&mdash;a
chevron between three crosses crosslet. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
ground to the right of the shield, and in contact
with it, is the helmet, supporting on a wreath the
crest&mdash;an arm vested and couped at the elbow,
holding in the hand a crossed crosslet. Across the
sinister chief corner of the shield, and trailing thence
to the ground, is thrown the riband bearing the
motto <i>In labore quies</i>. The date of the book-plate
is probably about 1810.</p>

<p>Not only Newcastle itself, but the whole line of
country along the river thence to Tynemouth,
seems to have been Bewick's sketching ground, and
many of his sketches he used for book-plates.
Jarrow and Tynemouth itself were particularly
favourite spots. Of the latter place his views
were mostly taken from the sea, and afford us
delightful pictures of water, shipping, and the ruins
of Tynemouth Priory. The book-plate of 'Charles
Charlton, M.D.,' is one of these.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 575px;"><a id="SOUTHEY"></a>
<img src="images/i_127.jpg" width="575" height="379" alt="shield leaning against a rock surrounded by bushes" />
<span class="caption">SOUTHEY&#39;S BOOK-PLATE BY BEWICK.</span>
</div>

<p>A great many of the ordinary bits of landscape
which Bewick used for book-plates he afterwards
utilised as tailpieces for various books illustrated
by him. The book-plate of the 'Rev. H. Cotes,
Vicar of Bedlington, 1802,' which shows us the
reverend gentleman busily engaged in fishing, doubtless
a favourite sport with him, is an instance of this
diverted use; but in this case we know the history
of the plate. Mr. Cotes had practically edited the
artist's second volume of <i>British Birds</i>, and, as a
slight return, Bewick prepared for him the book-plate
in question; but, owing to a subsequent quarrel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a><br /><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the artist never gave the parson the block, turning it
instead to his own account.</p>

<p>There are a great many more copper-plate book-plates
by Bewick than is generally supposed. One
of the most elaborate is that of 'Buddle Atkinson,'
which represents a bubbling trout-stream, into which
an angler casts his line: in the foreground is a crest
enclosed in a shield. Other copper-plate work by
Bewick is found in the book-plates of 'Edward
Moises, A.M.'&mdash;a shield of arms, with books, pens,
artists' tools of all kinds, and musical instruments;
'James Charlton' and 'A. Clapham'&mdash;Tyneside
scenes; 'J. H. Affleck, Newcastle-upon-Tyne'&mdash;a
shield of arms, in the midst of flowers and foliage;
'Tho<sup>s</sup> Carr, Newcastle'&mdash;a spring of water flowing
from a rock; and some few others.</p>

<p>Examples of the more unusual designs in Bewick's
book-plates, <i>i.e.</i> those in which scenery is not
depicted, are found in the book-plates of 'John
Anderson, St. Petersburgh'&mdash;a sportsman on horseback,
which was afterwards utilised as a vignette in
<i>British Birds;</i> 'Mr. Bigges'&mdash;a figure of liberty;
'Alex<sup>r</sup> Doeg, shipbuilder'&mdash;a just-completed ship,
still standing on the stocks; and several others,
which simply show the shield of arms and owner's
name.</p>

<p>One reason why Bewick was so successful as an
engraver of book-plates lay in the fact that his ability
was most conspicuous in a small design. The work
of such men as Hogarth or Bartolozzi seems cramped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
when it appears on the small scale which alone a
book-plate can admit; but with Bewick, the smaller
the size of the scene he desired to represent, the
greater was his skill in introducing into it both
originality and beauty.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>GERMAN BOOK-PLATES</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">I have</span> said that the use of book-plates, whether as
commemorative of gifts or as marks of ownership,
originated in Germany. Here, well before the close
of the fifteenth century, we find at least three undoubted
book-plates, examples of which have survived
until the present day, and have recently been
discovered fulfilling the function for which they were
originally intended.</div>

<p>Fastened to the cover of an old Latin vocabulary
was discovered the most ancient of these book-plates.
It is printed from a wood-block, and is
rough in execution. It shows us a hedgehog carrying
a flower in its mouth, trampling over fallen
leaves; above is the inscription, '<i>Hans Igler, das
dich ein igel kuss</i>.'</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a id="BUXHEIM"></a>
<img src="images/i_131.jpg" width="300" height="319" alt="Angel holding shild with ox on it" />
<span class="caption">BOOK-PLATE OF HILDEBRANDE BRANDENBURG.</span>
</div>

<p>Following, in point of date, closely after this
curious book-plate, comes a small woodcut, representing
an angel who holds a shield, on which is displayed
a black ox, with a ring passed through its nose&mdash;the
arms of the Brandenburg family. A written inscription
beneath it states that the book for which it
was intended, and in which it was found, belonged to
Hildebrande Brandenburg of Biberach, who presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a><br /><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
it to the Carthusian monastery of Buxheim, of
which he was a monk. This book-plate, which is
rudely coloured, is struck off on scraps of paper,
printed on one side; a curious illustration of the
then scarcity of that material. Oddly enough, another
very early book-plate&mdash;probably of almost
the same date as the last&mdash;was also found in a book
which belonged to the same monastery, and which
had been given to it by Wilhelm von Zell. This
book-plate also is anonymous; but the volumes
that contained it, as in the last case, bear a written
inscription, recording the fact that they belonged
to the monastery in question, and were the gift of
the person whose arms are figured in the book-plate
inserted.</p>

<p>From the fact that two of the three known
fifteenth century book-plates are connected with the
monastery at Buxheim, it would seem as if the use
of a book-plate commended itself to the librarian of
that monastery, who commemorated the gifts of
volumes by a book-plate bearing the donor's arms.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century, German book-plates
became numerous, and of their beauty there can be
no doubt. There is a difficulty, however, in accepting
many of the early armorial woodcuts which one finds;
and it is this: Suppose the example is no longer
doing duty in a volume as a book-plate, there is
really no means of being assured that the cut of arms
is a book-plate at all; for very many of these plates
are void of any inscription, save perhaps a text or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
motto. Some of these book-plates are probably
the work, or from the design, of Albert D&uuml;rer. He
certainly produced some undoubted examples; the
earliest, actually dated, in 1516. This is the Ebner
book-plate (see <a href="#Page_119">p. 119</a>). The inscription on this
leaves us in no doubt as to its intended use:
'Liber Hieronimi Ebner, 1516.'</p>

<p>Eight years after completing the Ebner plate,
D&uuml;rer engraved on copper a Portrait plate of Bilibald
Pirckheimer, a Nuremberg jurist of some note, who
became councillor to Maximilian <span class='small'>I.</span>, and was the
owner of a library, whose subsequent history has
been told in 'Books about Books' by Mr. Elton in his
<i>Great Book Collectors</i>. Now this Portrait plate, which
is dated 1524, was undoubtedly used by Pirckheimer
as his book-plate. There are plenty of known instances
in which it may be still found fastened in
at the end of a volume. Whether or not it was
intended for any other purpose than that which
I have here mentioned, we cannot say, for it bears
no inscription expressing its use. However&mdash;very
possibly at the same date&mdash;D&uuml;rer designed for
Pirckheimer what was, without doubt, intended for
a book-plate, since it bears the inscription, 'Liber
Bilibaldi Pirckheimer.' This is, in many instances,
found on the front cover of volumes which also
contain the book-plate last described fastened on the
back cover.</p>

<p>It is a very striking book-plate. A strangely large
helmet, on which is placed an equally large crest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
surmounts a pair of shields. The dexter one bears
the arms of Pirckheimer&mdash;a <i>birke</i> or birch-tree; whilst
the sinister bears those of his wife, Margretha Rieterin&mdash;a
crowned mermaid with two tails, each of which
she holds in her hands. Pirckheimer's arms show
the curious punning heraldry of the time, the <i>birke</i>
being, no doubt, a playful allusion to the jurist's
name. Clasping the helmet are two angels. On
either side of the shield is a large cornucopia apparently
filled with grapes and vine leaves, and amongst
these stands a smaller angel holding one end of a
heavy festoon, the other end of which is fastened
to a ram's head, the centre of the design. Angels,
apparently at play, are also represented below the
shield. Examples of this plate are not uncommon
in English collections, many of Pirckheimer's books
having passed into the Library of the Royal Society,
and some of these having been sold as duplicates,
when they were bought up by collectors for the sake
of the book-plate. Sir Wollaston Franks points out
to me that there is yet a third variety of Pirckheimer's
book-plate, which is signed 'J. B. 1529,' and
is not the work of D&uuml;rer.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 471px;"><a id="EBNER"></a>
<img src="images/i_135.jpg" width="471" height="600" alt="EBNER" />
</div>

<p>The book-plate of Hector P&ouml;mer, provost of the
Church of St. Laurence at Nuremberg, dated in 1525,
is also ascribed to D&uuml;rer, though it is signed with the
initials 'R. A.' This signature is probably that of
the artist who cut the design upon wood, for it is
now maintained that D&uuml;rer himself only made the
drawings for the woodcuts known as his; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a><br /><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
mechanical operation of cutting being handed over
to assistants. The P&ouml;mer plate is the earliest dated
book-plate which bears a signature either of the
designer or the engraver.</p>

<p>The size of this really fine example of early wood-engraving
is 13 inches by 9. On the principal shield
in the design we have what are no doubt the arms
of the monastery, the gridiron of St. Laurence,
quartering those of P&ouml;mer. The gridiron is on the
first and fourth quarters, whilst the second and third
contain what is heraldically described as <i>per bend
sable (?) and argent, three bendlets of the first</i>. We
say 'sable,' because the dark mass which the artist
has here shown is probably meant to represent this,
but any dark colour may have been intended, as I
have already endeavoured to show (see <a href="#Page_23">p. 23</a>). These
last arms are very probably P&ouml;mer's, for, in one of
the small shields which appear in each of the four
corners of the design, they occur again&mdash;the other
three shields being most likely filled with arms
quartered by the P&ouml;mer family. The helmet surmounting
the principal shield is without wreath, and
the crest is a demi-nun. The motto, 'To the pure all
things are pure,' is given, as in other of D&uuml;rer's book-plates,
in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. In charge of the
shield stands St. Laurence himself, dressed in a monk's
garb, and holding in his right hand the instrument
of his martyrdom, and in his left the palm of
martyrdom. The nimbus appears around his head.
The beauty of the design is apparent at the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
glance, and it becomes more apparent as we look
into it.</p>

<p>Dr. Hector P&ouml;mer was the last Prior of the Abbey
of St. Laurence in Nuremberg. To him Erasmus gave
a copy of his edition of the works of St. Ambrose,
issued from Froben's press. That very copy is in
the possession of the Rev. H. W. Pereira, and in
each of the two thick volumes in which the work is
contained is P&ouml;mer's book-plate. One is struck
with the exquisite detail and treatment; as Mr.
Pereira says, in describing the plate, the expression
and figure of St. Laurence is full of sweetness and
tender pathos.</p>

<p>The list of 'Armories' by D&uuml;rer, as printed by
Bartsch in vol. vii. of the <i>Peintre-Graveur</i>, gives us
some twenty examples, any of which may have been
used as book-plates. Some idea as to whether or
not an early armorial plate is really a book-plate
may, however, be gained by taking its measurement.
A very large engraving should be regarded with
suspicion, though not necessarily rejected as a book-plate
on account of its size. Sir Wollaston Franks
possesses a magnificent book-plate, measuring no less
than 14 &times; 10 inches, which is at this moment still
fulfilling its original functions. This is certainly the
largest example yet discovered. It has been known
to collectors for some time in what was believed to
be a perfect state, but the copy just mentioned
shows that what was thought to be the whole was in
reality only a portion of the design, since it lacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the elaborate framework, which is richly embellished
with weapons and ensigns, as well as with musical
instruments of every description. This book-plate
belonged to Count Maximilian Louis Breiner, a
distinguished official of the Emperor of Austria in
Lombardy. A striking feature in it is the introduction,
above the arms of the owner of the plate,
of those of Austria, surmounted by the imperial
crown, supported by a couple of cherubs. Both
the design and engraving are the work of Giuseppe
Petrarca, who probably produced them during the
closing years of the seventeenth century.</p>

</div>

<p>Quite in a distinct style from the other German
book-plates mentioned is that figured opposite, which
may be dated about the year 1530. It is interesting
from its owner, one Paulus Speratus, an ardent
preacher of the Lutheran doctrine at Augsburg,
W&uuml;rttemberg, Salzburg, and Vienna, and afterwards
Bishop of Pomerania, who proved himself ready to
undergo suffering in the cause he imagined to be
right. He was born in 1484, and died in 1554. The
shading in the arms is very peculiar, expressing as it
does, on the first and fourth divisions of the shield,
<i>argent</i> and <i>vert</i> at a period, as we have seen, long
anterior to the use of lines or dots to express the
metals or tinctures in heraldry. An explanation is
no doubt to be found in the fact that the artist
only intended to represent some light colour in
the shaded parts, in the same way as in the
second and third divisions of the shield he desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a><br /><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
in the thickly inked parts to represent <i>sable</i>. The
book-plate is now preserved in a copy of the
Psalms translated into Russian by Francis Skorina,
and printed at Wilna about the year 1525. The
peculiar inscription on this book-plate is referred to
on <a href="#Page_166">p. 166</a>.</p>

<p>We have spoken somewhat fully about these early
examples of German book-plates, because, both from
the fact that they are the earliest known to us, and
that several of them are the designs of Albert D&uuml;rer,
they have a very special interest. Space precludes
the possibility of alluding in detail to later German
examples, though they are, many of them, exceedingly
beautiful specimens of the engraver's art, as
indeed they may well be considering the men who
engraved them&mdash;Lucas Cranach, Jost Amman, Hans
Troschel, Wolffgang Kilian of Augsburg, and the
uncle and nephew Giles and Joseph Sadeler.</p>

<p>Let me, however, speak very tersely of a few
examples of the productions of these artists, in order
that the reader's attention may be attracted should
he come across a specimen of their work.</p>

<p>Two woodcuts by Lucas Cranach have certainly
been used as book-plates, though not designed by
the artist as such, for they both appear among other
cuts in a work illustrated by him. Sir Wollaston
Franks possesses both varieties. In one, we have
a half-length figure of St. Paul. He is seated, and
reading a book, the lines of which he follows with
his finger. His head is surrounded with the nimbus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
whilst a shaggy beard nearly covers the face. The
right hand holds a double sword with the points
upwards; beneath this is the shield of the Elector
of Saxony. Above the upper line of the plate is
an inscription, showing that it was intended to mark
the volumes belonging to the 'preachership' ('Predicatur')
at Oringen. The other woodcut by Cranach
is very similar in design, but the figure represented is
that of St. Peter, and it bears the inscription 'Stadt
Orngau.'</p>

<p>It is worth remarking that in one instance at
least, on removing the book-plate portraying St.
Paul, a smaller hand-drawn book-plate was found,
which consisted of a shield half red and half white,
and upon it a key, placed in pale, countercharged.
There is no inscription on this book-plate, nor is
there any margin shown&mdash;the paper being cut close
to the design.</p>

<p>Jost Amman is another German artist who leaves
us in a difficulty as to deciding as to which of his
many armorial engravings were really intended for
book-plates. One undoubted book-plate by him,
however, exists, and this was designed for a member
of the Nuremberg family of Holzschuher&mdash;'Wooden
shoes.' Wooden shoes, or sabots, appear as charges
on the shield, and afford another example of the
punning heraldry which was then fashionable in
Germany. This is a fine book-plate, engraved on
copper, and signed 'J. A.'; its size, 7<span class='small'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> &times; 6<span class='small'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inches.
The shield is supported by two angels and a lion.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Hans Sibmacher or Siebmacher was another
Nuremberg engraver; he worked there quite at
the close of the sixteenth century and in the early
years of the seventeenth. He also executed a book-plate
for a member of the Holzschuher family. This
is a more elaborate piece of work than Amman's,
though smaller (4<span class='small'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> &times; 3<span class='small'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inches). Its characteristic
feature is a closely-woven wreath of leaves, with
clusters of fruit and ornaments introduced at intervals.
Seated on this wreath, at the top of the design,
are two reading cherubs clothed in 'nature unadorned.'
Below the design is an oblong and indented
bracket.</p>

<p>Hans Troschel's work as a book-plate engraver is
illustrated by the book-plate of yet another Nuremberg
man&mdash;John William Kress of Kressenstain,
dated in 1619. In this we are shown a shield set
in an oval wreath of leaf-work. The helmet which
surmounts it displays some elaborate work; finely-cut
mantling extends itself from this on the right
side and on the left; and above is a cornet, which
encircles the crest. The whole is enclosed in a
circle of leaves and berries, somewhat similar to that
just described in speaking of Sibmacher's work; but
outside this, at each of the four corners of the plate,
are small shields surmounted by helmets and crests,
and containing the arms of the four families from
which he immediately descended, their names being
given. Nestling amongst the mantling on the left
side of the design is a distinct shield, on which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
depicted the arms of Susanna Koler, wife of the
owner of the book-plate.</p>

<p>Wolffgang Kilian (born 1581, died 1662) was an
Augsburg man, and the book-plate which bears his
signature and the date, 1635, is that of an Augsburg
church dignitary&mdash;Sebastian Myller, suffragan-bishop
of Adramytteum, and Canon of Augsburg.
In its ornamentation it bears some resemblance to
an English Jacobean book-plate. Above the shield
is the head of a cherub, on which the episcopal
mitre is made to rest in a somewhat comical manner;
the cherub's wings protrude over the top of, and into,
the shield. The inscription is contained in an oval
band; outside this is an oval leaf-wreath, and outside
this again an indented frame. Wolffgang was a
younger brother of the more noted Lucas Kilian.
Both brothers studied at Venice, and were pupils of
their stepfather, Dominick Custos, who was himself a
designer of book-plates.</p>

<p>Of Giles Sadeler's work&mdash;the Count of Rosenberg's
book-plate&mdash;I shall speak directly (<a href="#Page_130">pp. 130</a>, <a href="#Page_131">131</a>). An
example of his nephew's engraving is afforded by
the book-plate of Ferdinand von Hagenau, dated in
1646.</p>

<p>In later times&mdash;the eighteenth century&mdash;other distinguished
German artists 'stooped' to book-plate
engraving. Amongst them was Daniel Nicholas
Chodowiecki (the son of a Dantzig drug merchant),
born in 1726. Chodowiecki is best known as a book-illustrator,
in which his great knowledge of costume&mdash;at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a period when the point was little studied&mdash;stood
him in good stead. His book-plates are probably
few; only four or five are known. One of the most
elaborate in design is that of a German doctor of
medicine, dated in 1792, nine years before the artist's
death.</p>

<p>In this example much of the sensational style of
the generality of his work manifests itself. 'The
book-plate,' says Lord De Tabley, 'in its motive
reminds us much of those allegoric framed certificates
of membership which various sick clubs and benefit
societies accord to their members at the present day.
In the foreground, &AElig;sculapius is pushing out a
skeleton draped in a long white sheet, with a scythe
across its shoulder. The god is sturdily applying
his serpent-twined staff to the somewhat too solid
back of the terrible phantom. Behind, beneath a
kind of pavilion, lies a sick person in bed; his hands
are upraised in silent thankfulness as he watches the
prowess of the healing deity.' The book-plate was
engraved for Dr. C. S. Schintz. Besides this, Chodowiecki
engraved, about 1770, a book-plate for himself,
and, about ten years later, one for the French
seminary at Berlin.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 341px;"><a id="WOOGIANA"></a>
<img src="images/i_145.jpg" width="341" height="600" alt="WOOGIANA" />
</div>

<p>The book-plate of Dr. Schintz calls to mind a
somewhat earlier German example, engraved by
Boetius from a design by Wernerin (whose signature
appears on some varieties of the plate), about the
middle of the last century. It is figured opposite,
and is perhaps <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'th '">the</ins> most gloomy book-plate that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a><br /><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
ever entered into the mind of man to conceive. A
skeleton sits upon a coffin, or a coffin-shaped tomb,
holding in his right hand a pair of scales, and in his
left a scythe; in the lighter balance of the scales is
a scroll, bearing the inscription, 'Dan. v. 25, <i>Mene
Tekel</i>'; in the background we see monuments, Lombardy
poplars or cypress-trees, and a distant landscape.
This uninviting picture is contained in a
frame, inscribed, in a medallion above, 'E Bibliotheca
Woogiana,' and below, <i>Nominor &acirc; libra: libratus ne
levis unquam Inveniar, pr&aelig;sta pondere, Christe, tuo</i>,&mdash;a
motto in which the owner makes a play upon the
derivation of his name from <i>wage</i>, the German for a
weight or balance, and asks the bestowal of divine
weight on the day of soul-weighing.</p>

<p>As compared with German book-plates, those of
other countries are sadly deficient in artistic composition.
The former, particularly examples of the
seventeenth century, are ornate and well designed.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the really magnificent book-plate
of Peter Vok, Ursinus, Count of Rosenberg,
dated '1609.' It is engraved on copper, and measures
10 inches by 6. In a central circular medallion, 3<span class='small'><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span>
inches in diameter, is depicted the owner, arrayed
in armour, and seated on a richly caparisoned
war-horse, plumed, and going at full speed across
a landscape of hillocks. On his breastplate is an
escutcheon bearing his arms; a knight's sword is
in his hand. Round the margin of the medallion
runs a wreath of roses. Platforms come out on either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
side of the medallion, and on each of these there
stands a figure about 5 inches in height; the one on
the left is a female symbolical form, clad in flowing
drapery, and holding in one hand the cup of the
Eucharist, and in the other a cross. A somewhat
similar figure stands on the right, holding in her
hand a tablet, inscribed <i>Verbum Domini manet in
eternum</i>.</p>

<p>The medallion rests upon two bears&mdash;an allusion,
of course, to the family name of the owner, <i>Ursinus</i>&mdash;crouching
between the two female figures described.
The face of the altar-like platform below is divided
into one central and two lateral compartments, of
which the side ones project forward. On the right
lateral slab is an escutcheon, charged simply with
the Rosenberg rose; whilst on the left we see the
family arms, as on the breastplate, but surmounted
with an ermine-faced crown. On the central slab
is a skull resting on two shin-bones.</p>

<p>Reaching across the upper portion of the design
is an oblong tablet, with indented shelly scroll-work
edges, and a background border of large full-blown
roses, with thorny stems. With the inscription,
which is appropriately pompous, I need not trouble
the reader; but I have thought it worth while to give
here (following Lord De Tabley's example, and using
sometimes his words) a very full verbal picture of this
truly magnificent book-plate, in order that the pitch
of elaboration to which a German book-plate can be
carried may be understood. Suffice it to add that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
this work of art was engraved by Giles Sadeler,
the Antwerp-born engraver, who, after studying in
Italy, was invited by the Emperor Rudolph <span class='small'>II.</span> to
enter his service at Prague; in short, to become
what he styles himself in his signature to this book-plate&mdash;'Engraver
to His Imperial Majesty.'</p>

<p>Less elaborate, yet very beautifully engraved, are
the book-plates used in the Electoral Library of the
Dukes of Bavaria at Munich. On one, dated in
1618, the largest variety of which is 7 inches high
and 5&frac12; broad, we have the arms of the Duchy
enclosed by the collar of the Golden Fleece. Winged
Caryatides support the Electoral crown, whilst below
is an arabesqued platform, on which is the inscription:
<i>Ex Bibliotheca Serenissimorum Utriusque Bavari&aelig;
Ducum</i>, 1618. A smaller variety of this plate is
figured opposite. Some twenty years later, a still
larger and more ornate book-plate (10 &times; 7 inches)
was designed for use in the same library. Here
the arms are in an oval frame, surrounded by the
Golden Fleece; on the right and left are inverted
cornucopi&aelig;, and the crown is held aloft by four
cherubs. All the book-plates of this library exist in
a great variety of design, and nearly all the varieties
are found in different sizes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 359px;"><a id="BAVARIA"></a>
<img src="images/i_149.jpg" width="359" height="500" alt="ELECTORAL LIBRARY OF BAVARIA" />
</div>

<p>These examples are typical of many other German
book-plates; the conception of the design is excellent,
and its working out is equally good. In later
times, the work on book-plates perhaps deteriorated,
because it fell, to a large extent, into inferior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a><br /><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
hands. Yet Germany can show several very creditable
examples in the eighteenth century. Some of those
which give the view of a library interior are decidedly
pleasing; they appear soon after the commencement
of the century. The libraries represented have
usually one or more mythological inmates; but, in
one instance, the owner is in possession, and is seen
hard at work amongst his volumes.</p>

<p>In concluding this chapter, it may be noted that
examples of name-tickets are found in Germany
as in other countries. Perhaps the earliest is one
(first noticed, I believe, by Mr. Weale) in a copy at
the Bodleian Library of a German Psalter printed
at Augsburg in 1498. This reads, 'Sum Magistri
Georgii Mayrii Monacencis' [<i>i.e.</i> of Munich], with the
motto, 'Melius est pro veritate pati supplicium, quam
pro adulatione consequi beneficium.' The same inscription
has been written in ink on the title-page,
with the added date 1513, and afterwards&mdash;no doubt
a few years later when the label was printed and
placed in the book&mdash;crossed through.</p>

<p>The most complete work on German book-plates
that has yet made its appearance is Herr Warnecke's
<i>Die Deutschen B&uuml;cherzeichen</i>, Berlin, 1890; but a work
properly classifying the different styles of German
book-plates, and affixing to these styles covering
dates, has yet to be written.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BOOK-PLATES OF FRANCE AND OTHER COUNTRIES</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">France</span>, so far as a generally descriptive account
of her book-plates is concerned, is certainly more
fortunate than her neighbour Germany. French
book-plates received attention, in the shape of a
capital work upon them, before those of any other
country were similarly honoured. M. Poulet Malassis's
<i>Les Ex libris Fran&ccedil;ais</i> made its first appearance in
1874, and bears evident testimony to the fact that
the author had for many years previously made an
attentive study of his native book-plates.</div>

<p>Since the appearance of M. Poulet Malassis's work,
book-plate collecting in France, as well as in other
countries, has been vigorously carried on, and earlier
examples of dated French book-plates than those
then known have come to light. The most ancient
of these is one dated 1574 (the same year, it will be
noted, as that of the plate of Sir Nicholas Bacon),
but it is simply typographical, having no kind of
design whatever. It reads: 'Ex bibliotheca Caroli
Albosii E. Eduensis. Ex labore quies.' No Armorial
book-plate bearing an engraved date appears in
France until thirty-seven years later, when we, at last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
meet with that of Alexandre Bouchart, Vicomte de
Bloss&eacute;ville, engraved by L&eacute;onard Gaultier, and, in
the copy in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, dated 1611.
A variety of this book-plate, undated, unsigned, and
probably not by the same hand, exists in the collection
of Sir Wollaston Franks. The field in the
Bouchart arms is gules, though the lines shown in
the engraving of the undated plate would, according
to the present system, represent it as azure (see
remarks on this point at <a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a>). After the Bouchart
book-plate, we have, in 1613, that of Melchior de la
Vall&eacute;e, Canon of Nancy, given by M. Poulet Malassis
as dated in 1611, and then, in 1644, a roughly-executed
anonymous book-plate signed 'Raigniauld
Riomi, 1644.' The arms are untinctured, and leaflike
mantling falling from the helmet surrounds the
shield; there is no crest. Raigniauld&mdash;or, as the
modern spelling of the name is, Regnault&mdash;is not a
known engraver. Riomi is an old-fashioned town
of Auvergne.</p>

<p>Other French book-plates of the seventeenth century,
both dated and undated, exist; but France is
undeniably behind Germany both in the number of
her early book-plates and in their beauty; for instance,
we do not in France find those numerous book-plates
of ecclesiastical corporations which so much
swell the list of early German examples. The subject
of French ecclesiastical book-plates has, indeed,
received special treatment from Father Ingold, himself
a French ecclesiastic; and he is compelled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
admit that such book-plates are not numerous and
not ancient. The old way seems to have been for
the monastic official in charge of the convent library
to inscribe each volume with some appropriate inscription.
These are in themselves interesting; but
book-plate lovers must regret the existence of the
fashion. The earliest French ecclesiastical book-plates
belong to the middle of the eighteenth century,
and, like the 1574 example already noticed, they are
mere typographical labels, possessing little more artistic
merit than is usually displayed in a post-mark.</p>

<p>With regard, however, to the book-plates of ecclesiastical
individuals, the case is different; some of
them engraved during the seventeenth century are
ambitious and interesting. A particularly quaint
example is found in the book-plate which an Annecy
engraver, named Sinton, executed for Charles de
Sales, the energetic labourer in the cause of religion,
brother of St. Francis de Sales, and his successor
in the Bishopric of Annecy. Lord De Tabley thus
describes the book-plate:&mdash;'The family arms are
shown in a shield, which appears very gigantic, in a
frame of heavy curves, which is set in the centre of a
huge sideboard-like monumental structure. On the
top ledges of this, two full-grown, long-skirted angels,
seated right and left, uphold the episcopal hat (with
its usual knotted ropes and tassels) in air above the
escutcheon.</p>

<p>'At the base of the structure, to the right, appears
a figure of St. Francis de Sales, seated, holding an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
olive branch in one hand, while beneath his other
arm is a profuse cluster of fruit. To the left, also
seated, is a portrait of St. Jane Frances De Chantal,
holding a palm-branch, also with fruit beneath her
other arm. Each portrait is realistic, and not in the
least flattered. Between them is a medallion bearing
the crossed papal keys.'</p>

<p>The probable date of this very curious book-plate
is 1642. It appears earlier, but this may be
accounted for by the fact that the work is provincial.
Students will do well to remember that provincially
executed book-plates, English or foreign, are often
misleading in this respect.</p>

<p>There is a somewhat elaborate book-plate, engraved
in several sizes, and dated in 1692, which
introduces the cardinal's hat, mitre, and crozier, and
which was prepared to place in the books given by
Dr. Peter Daniel Huet to the Paris Jesuits. Huet is
himself an interesting figure in French literature. In
1670 he was made tutor to the Dauphin, and whilst
so employed he assisted in bringing out the sixty-two
volumes of classics, specially prepared for his
pupil, known as the <i>Delphin</i> edition. He became
Bishop of Avranches in 1689, but ten years after resigned
his see in order to devote the remainder of his
life to literature, which he did, completing amongst
other voluminous works a defence of the doctrine of
Christianity.</p>

<span class="caption">BOOK-PLATE OF CHARLES DE SALES.</span>
</div>

<p>It is from their possessors that French book-plates
derive their chief interest; and these possessors are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a><br /><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
for the most part persons who lived at a late date.
Amongst the few early celebrities is the soldier-poet
of France, Francis de Malherbe, of whom it has been
said that he was as lax in morals as he was rigid in
his zeal for the purity of his native language. His
book-plate is figured at <a href="#Page_25">p. 25</a>, and is interesting as
showing that no reliance can be placed on lines,
apparently expressing the colour of the shield in
early Armorial book-plates (see <a href="#Page_21">pp. 21-22</a>). He died
in 1628. The books containing this very pleasing
book-plate passed after De Malherbe's death to
Vincent de Boyer, in whose family they remained
till the Revolution; after that they were dispersed.</p>

<p>Coming to later times, we find a charming book-plate,
engraved by Le Grand for the unfortunate
Countess Dubarry. Her books were well chosen and
well bound, but they were few in number; hence her
book-plate is rare, but it may be seen in the library
at Versailles, where most of her books are preserved.
Though she could not read, she seems to have felt
in duty bound to follow 'La Pompadour' in getting
together a library to amuse her royal master.</p>

<p>From the book-plate of the countess&mdash;a woman
who, after aiding in the general degradation of the
French court, was willing to risk her life for those
whose downfall she had in a measure assisted in
bringing about&mdash;we may appropriately turn to that
of Cardinal Maury; the inscription on which reads:
<i>Biblioth&egrave;que particuli&egrave;re de son Eminence Mgr. le
Cardinal Maury</i>. This book-plate calls to mind a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
famous figure in the French Revolution,&mdash;a fervent
preacher, the spokesman of his fellow-clergy before
those who were but little inclined to listen to argument;
the calm-minded man, who would turn round
and give a witty retort to a cry raised by the mob
which followed through the streets of Paris, clamouring
for his blood.</p>

<p>The mention of these names leads one naturally to
speak generally of book-plates engraved about the
time of the French Revolution,&mdash;a period which is
immortalised in a singular manner on French book-plates.
M. Poulet Malassis remarks that many a
noble library owner took good care to alter his book-plate
in those troublesome times, and to replace the
coronet which had surmounted the family escutcheon
by the Phrygian cap of liberty. For instance, the
Viscount de Borbon-Busset in 1793 changed his
Armorial book-plate to a simple inscription&mdash;in which
he calls himself 'Citoyen Fran&ccedil;ois'&mdash;surrounded by a
leafy garland. The same fashion is exemplified even
in clerical examples. Father le Mercier in his first
book-plate displays the coronet which he either was,
or at least considered himself to be, entitled to bear;
but between 1789 and 1792 we find a second example
of his book-plate, with a simple decorative finish to the
top of the design in lieu of the coronet. At that time
there was in France, as Mr. Walter Hamilton puts it,
'an awkward fashion of putting heads accustomed
to coronets under the falling knife of the guillotine.'</p>

<p>As far as the classifying of the leading styles in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
French book-plates goes, M. Poulet Malassis does
not really help us much; and we cannot but hope
that ere long some enterprising French collector will
undertake the task. There is certainly, as M. Poulet
Malassis observes, a resemblance&mdash;as the reader
will see by turning back to the illustration of De
Malherbe's book-plate&mdash;between the style of the first
French book-plates and that of the first English;
and it is noteworthy that the style disappeared in
both countries much at the same time. Again,
French book-plates of 1720-1730 bear distinct traces
of what we have called 'Jacobean' work in speaking
of English examples.</p>

<p>The French <i>Rococo</i> book-plate is really analogous
to our 'Chippendale.' There is, however, a greater
variety both of subject and treatment in each French
style than one finds in England.</p>

<p>Allegory is, as I stated in <a href="#Page_72">Chapter iv.</a>, more frequent
and more wild in French book-plates than in those
of England. The follies of his own countrymen
in this respect are fully recognised by M. Poulet
Malassis, who, in most amusing style, deals with
some of the more pronounced examples; as for
instance the rollicking allegory displayed in the
book-plate of M. H&eacute;nault, President of the French
Academy. The date of this remarkable production
may be fixed at 1750; it is designed by Boucher
and engraved by Count de Caylus, and we see
that Minerva has honoured M. le Pr&eacute;sident by
placing his family arms upon her shield. Very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
wonderful, too, is the book-plate of the Abb&eacute; de
Gricourt, whose arms are borne heavenwards by a
vast company of angels. This example, which is
approximately of the same date as the last, is the
work of the Abb&eacute;'s brother, A. T. Ceys, who was himself
an ecclesiastic. Often the allegory displayed has
allusion to the owner's business or his tastes, as on that
of M. Gueullette, a French novelist and dramatist of
the first half of the last century, the popularity of
whose writings, although those writings are numerous,
has not outlived him. This book-plate is the work
of H. Becat, and is inscribed after the Pirckheimer
manner, 'Ex libris Thom&aelig; Gueullette et Amicorum.'
The family arms are supported by an Italian harlequin,
a Chinese mandarin, a Cyclops holding an infant, and
a Tartar. Now the presence of these strange inhabitants
of a book-plate is accounted for thus. Gueullette
wrote farces for the Paris stage, and he also wrote
'Contes Tartares' and 'Les Aventures du Mandarin
Fum Hoam.' Below the shield water pours from
a satyr's mouth into a basin containing a mermaid,
and above soars Cupid in clouds, bearing aloft a
scroll and motto. This, says 'W. H.' in the <i>Ex Libris
Journal</i>, is probably one of the earliest book-plates on
which appear allegoric allusions to its owner's tastes
and literary labours.</p>

<p>The <i>Typical</i> or <i>Personal</i> book-plate is also found in
France in that of the Chevalier de Fleurieu, described
by Mr. Egerton Castle. During the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i> he
was a naval officer, who, whilst still low in the service,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
was intrusted with the testing of various new marine
appliances. On the book-plate we get the bird's-eye
view of an island, on which are strewn the said marine
appliances, and behind them stands the Chevalier's
coat of arms.</p>

<p>A recent writer on French book-plates, M. Henri
Bouchot, goes so far as to think a book-plate may be
of service as exhibiting a man's character. It may
be so with regard to Frenchmen and French book-plates,
but if this principle of argument be applied to
English book-plates, all I can say is, that the possessors
of English book-plates in the closing years
of the seventeenth century and the opening years of
the eighteenth must have been singularly alike in
their personal characteristics!</p>

<p>The 'Library Interior' book-plate is found in
France as early as 1718, in an anonymous book-plate
described by Mr. Walter Hamilton in the <i>Book Worm</i>
for May 1892. It shows us, in the background of a
library, two men working a printing-press. In the
foreground are five little winged cupids at play with
books and mathematical instruments, whilst a female
figure, representing peace and plenty, appears seated
on what Mr. Hamilton conjectures to be a Pegasus.
The engraving is by Bernard Picart, an eminent engraver,
who, though a Frenchman by birth, settled
at Amsterdam in 1710 (he died in 1733) and was
evidently much influenced by the then prevailing
style in Dutch art. He executed another very beautiful
'Library Interior' plate (figured opposite) for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a><br /><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Amadeus Lulin, a Savoyard. Here we have the
interior of a French library of the period, with a
curved roof. At the end of the room is a window
and beneath this a Louis <span class='small'>XV.</span> table. In the foreground
the same cupids 'play with books,' which, by
the way, they are treating exceedingly badly. Caryatides
at the sides form a frame for the plate. On the
breast of one is a sun; the other holds a heart. A
globe surmounts each. The arms are shown in the
centre of the design at the top.</p>

<p>Other examples of French book-plates of this kind
are found quite late in the century, and any one who
feels specially interested in the subject of these, and
indeed of 'Library Interior' book-plates as a whole,
will do well to study Sir Arthur Vicars's valuable
treatise and lists in the pages of the <i>Ex Libris Journal</i>.</p>

<p>About the book-plates of countries other than
Germany and France there is not very much to be
said. Sweden has given us an insight into its native
book-plates.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Herr Carlander tells us that the earliest
date on a Swedish book-plate is 1595, which occurs
on that belonging to Thure Bielke, a senator who,
having mixed himself up in political strife, lost his
head by a stroke of the executioner's axe five years
later. Senator Bielke was evidently far in advance
of his fellow-countrymen as regards such matters;
for no other dated Swedish book-plate occurs for
a considerable number of years. In the eighteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
century, however, Swedish book-plates became much
more numerous, and some of the more prominent
native engravers appear to have worked upon them,
producing a few singularly fine examples in the
<i>Rococo</i> style; library interiors also appear occasionally
on Swedish book-plates. One of the most
interesting late examples of book-plates of this
country is that of King Charles <span class='small'>XIII.</span> On this we
have the royal arms of Sweden, surmounted by the
collar and cross of the order of the Seraphim, and
the king's motto, 'Folkets w&auml;l mint hogsta lag'&mdash;'The
people's weal my highest law.' I imagine that
this book-plate may be placed at the close of the
last century. Charles died in 1818.</p>

<p>Swiss book-plates are numerous and early. The
first dated example occurs in 1607. Their general
style is not pleasing, since it presents a stiffness and
awkwardness in the arrangement of the decoration.
Italian book-plates, again, possess few remarkable
features. Perhaps their leading characteristic is the
extreme coldness of their engravers' touch. One
of these engravers was, however, a famous man,
whose work deserves more than passing mention.
I mean Raphael Morghen, the Florentine artist,
who died in 1833, and who is said to have been
able to engrave a plate when he was only twelve
years old. It is curious to turn from his large
engravings of the chief works in the gallery at
Florence, to the unusually small work which enables
us to reckon him here among the engravers of book-plates.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
This is a representation of the arms of the
Duke of Cassano Serra, framed in a shelly frame,
somewhat 'Chippendale' in appearance, but with the
stiff, heavy 'Jacobean' wreath clinging closely to it.
In a scroll which winds in and out of this wreath
is the inscription: 'Il Duca Cassano Serra'; it is
signed 'R. Morghen f[ecit].'</p>

<p>A careful investigation of the Vatican and other
Italian libraries would probably lead to the discovery
of some more papal book-plates. Sir Wollaston
Franks tells me that amongst his numerous engravings
of the papal arms, there is only one which he
feels sure was ever used as a book-plate. The late
Sir George Dasent, in <i>Notes and Queries</i>,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> describes
what he considers the book-plate of Maffeo Barberini,
Urban <span class='small'>VIII.</span>; but he does not tell us what leads
him to the belief that the engraving is really a
book-plate.</p>

<p>About Spanish book-plates not much is yet known,
and it seems likely that the majority of examples
usually classed as Spanish were designed and
executed in Flanders. The family of Bouttats&mdash;the
original Bouttats had, says Walpole, twenty sons,
of whom twelve became engravers&mdash;executed some
of these book-plates. Amongst their work is one
which Lord De Tabley styles 'a gloomy yet striking
heraldic study'; it is signed 'P. B. Bouttats, sculp.,'
and was probably engraved about the middle of the
seventeenth century. It shows us the arms of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
bishop surmounted by a plumed helmet, above which
again is a bishop's hat, with pendent ropes and
tassels; beneath is the motto: 'Por la Le&yuml; Bezerra
&yuml; por el R&euml;y.' A particularly fine example of
Flemish heraldic art is furnished by the book-plate
engraved and signed by J. Harrewyn, of Brussels,
and dated 1723; the inscription gives us quite a
biographical sketch: 'Messire Charles Bonaventure,
Comte vander Noot, Baron de Schoonhoven et de
Mares &amp;c<sup>a</sup>; Conseiller de sa Ma<sup>te</sup> Imp<sup>le</sup> et Cath<sup>e</sup> au
souverain Conseil de Brabant par patante du 9 Mars
1713, Re&ccedil;u aux Etats nobles de Brabant, fils de
Messire Rogier Wouthier, en son vivant Baron de
Carloo &amp;c<sup>a</sup>; et deputez ordinaire au dit corps de la
noblesse des Etats de Brabant, et de Dame Anne
Lou&yuml;se vander Gracht, n&eacute;e Baronne de Vrempde et
d'Olmen, &amp;c<sup>a</sup>.'</p>

<p>Our knowledge of Russian or Polish book-plates
is chiefly derived from the illustrations shown in
Monsieur S. J. Siennicki's work, entitled <i>Les Elzevirs
de la Biblioth&egrave;que de L'Universit&eacute; Imp&eacute;riale de
Varsovie</i>. Here we have some examples of the
book-plates both of distinguished laymen and
ecclesiastics. The probability is that none are of
an early date, and they are certainly not conspicuous
as works of art. The Russian style is perhaps the
more distinct, though in many respects resembling
the French, especially that shown in the more pronounced
examples of the Louis <span class='small'>XV.</span> epoch.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AMERICAN BOOK-PLATES</div>


<div class='unindent'>WHATEVER an American collects, he collects well:
he works with a will and energy that loosens his
purse-strings in a manner which makes the acquisition
of valuable specimens a comparatively easy matter.
It is well, therefore, that book-plate collecting has
found its way over the Atlantic, and that there is
now a goodly body of American book-plate collectors
who are giving the requisite amount of attention to
American examples, and who are not keeping to
themselves the result of their labours. In the first
edition of this book I wrote: 'No doubt, ten years
hence, we shall know a great deal more about
American book-plates'; and already the appearance
of Mr. Charles Dexter Allen's<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> interesting and carefully
composed account of them has enabled me
materially to improve this chapter, which I have
devoted to them.</div>

<p>The majority of book-plates which bear upon them
American addresses, especially those belonging to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the Southern States, many of which appear with
the opening of the eighteenth century, are, without
doubt, the work of engravers in the then mother-country.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
The library owners of Virginia sent to
England for these book-plates, or their sons ordered
them there, whilst paying the orthodox visit to one
of the universities, and brought them home, either for
their own use or for the use of their fathers. The
northern book-plates, though much later, are mostly
the work of artists born and bred, or at least settled,
in America.</p>

<p>Foremost in interest and earliest in date of these
American address-plates is that of William Penn, on
which he styles himself 'Proprietor of Pensylvania.'
This is designed in the ordinary 'Simple Armorial'
style then common in England, and is dated in
1702. It is therefore subsequent to Penn's last
visit to his 'plantation,' and cannot have been the
work of an engraver on that side of the Atlantic.
After his death, the inscription on this book-plate
was altered, for his son's use, to 'Thomas
Penn of Stoke Pogeis, in the county of Bucks, first
proprietor of Pensilvania (<i>sic</i>).' The expression 'first'
must here be evidently read as 'chief' or 'principal.'
The fact of this alteration is important for collectors
to note, as copies of William Penn's book-plate are
frequently offered for sale, which&mdash;they are palpably
recent impressions&mdash;are said to be struck from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
original plate; a statement which, from the fact
mentioned, may be at once discredited.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Next in point of date is a much more ornate
book-plate, the inscription on which reads: 'William
Byrd of Westover, in Virginia, Esquire.' It is an
elaborate piece of work, excellently engraved in the
style of the majority of English book-plates of 1720 or
thereabouts, 'Simple Armorial,' but with indications
of Jacobean decoration. William Byrd was born in
Virginia, 28th March 1694; he was sent to England
to be educated, and returned to his native country,
having his mind 'stored with useful information to
adorn its annals, his manners cultivated in royal
Courts,' and with this book-plate, as a mark of his
devotion to literature.</p>

<p>The famous Westover mansion, which may to-day
be viewed from the James River, two hours' sail
below Richmond, was for long the viceregal Court
of Virginia. It was erected about the year 1678, by
William Byrd, who left England when very young,
and was father to his namesake, whose book-plate
has just been described, the author of the famous
<i>Westover Manuscripts</i>, compiled in 1732-33.</p>

<p>Some five years before the probable date of the
Byrd book-plate, we have note of that belonging
to 'Robert Elliston, gent., Comptrol<sup>r</sup> of His
Majestie's Customs of New York in America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
<span class='small'>MDCCXXV.</span>' This book-plate is quite 'Jacobean' in
style, and was no doubt executed in England, and
sent out to the colony. It is too fine a piece of work
to be the production of any colonial engraver of that
date.</p>

<p>But the interest attaching to book-plates bearing
upon them American addresses, and used by residents
in America, is obviously not so great as that
awakened by examples which were also actually
produced in America,&mdash;examples which at once give
us an insight into the state of the engraver's art, and
of the artistic feeling then existing there.</p>

<p>The earliest of these is the book-plate of the 'Rev.
John Williams,' first minister of Deerfield, Mass.,
dated in 1679. The next, in 1704, that of Thomas
Prince, an American born and bred, who graduated
from Harvard College in 1707, and paid his first visit
to England in 1709, so that his book-plate may be
taken as genuinely American. In design it resembles
dozens of English examples,&mdash;a rough woodcut border
of national emblems, within which is the inscription,
'Thom&aelig; Prince Liber, Anno Domini, 1704'; the sequence
of the words in the inscription, the reader will
notice, being somewhat unusual. The Prince Library
was bequeathed to a Society, which became known
as 'the New England Library,' and which itself had
a similar label prepared recording the gift. A part
of the collection is now in the Boston Public Library.</p>

<p>But these two examples stand by themselves; it
is not until the middle of the eighteenth century that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
any number of book-plates of American execution
are found; after that, there are a really considerable
quantity. Their style is not particularly distinctive;
it is at first either Jacobean or 'Chippendale,' or a
combination of the two styles; later, the 'wreath and
ribbon,' and landscape and pictorial styles are introduced
and treated much as in England. In execution,
American book-plates are perhaps a trifle coarse.
The more prominent of their engravers seem to have
been&mdash;Hurd, Dawkins, Anderson, Johnson, Callendar,
Doolittle, the Mavericks, Revere, and Turner. Revere
is the best known; he was a picture engraver of
some merit; but for the most part the names quoted
are those of men of little artistic reputation. Nathaniel
Hurd was probably the earliest of these engravers,
and not the worst. He was born at Boston in 1729,
the son of an American, who was a goldsmith in that
town. Nathaniel was his father's apprentice; he
devoted himself to working on copper, and so naturally
would turn his attention to book-plates. Probably
the earliest example, signed by him as 'N. H.,'
and dated in 1749, was designed for Thomas Dering.
This is the earliest signed and dated American book-plate
yet brought to light; Hurd was barely twenty
when he produced it. As a seal and book-plate
engraver he worked hard and well; he died in 1777.
One of his most original book-plates is that of
Harvard College. A curiously short and wide shield,
bearing the college arms, is encircled by a band
bearing the inscription, 'Sigill. Coll. Harvard. Cantab.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Nov. Angl. 1650.' Outside this circle are two leaf
sprays, tied at the base and nearly meeting at the
top. Both in conception and execution this is a
very peculiar book-plate. The Dering plate, on the
other hand, is interesting as showing how exactly
the style of the mother-country at that period was
copied in America. Here we have a pure 'Chippendale'
book-plate of an unpronounced type.</p>

<p>Henry Dawkins (who began life by designing
metal buttons) had been for a long time resident in
America, when, in 1754, he engraved the book-plate
of 'John Burnet of New York.' Like the Dering
plate, Burnet's is interesting, and for the same reason;
it is 'Chippendale,' but distinctly <i>later</i> Chippendale,
with cupids and other figures introduced. Dawkins
was found guilty of counterfeiting, and begged to be
hanged rather than suffer the imprisonment to which
he had been condemned. Whether or not his request
was granted we do not know.</p>

<p>That the heraldry on some of these American book-plates
should be startling, is only to be expected.
Take, for instance, the very interesting book-plate
of Robert Dinwiddie, Deputy-Governor of Virginia
from 1751-58, which was probably engraved a few
years before the earlier date. Here we have the
shield divided fesse-fashion, and in the upper and
lower divisions landscapes,&mdash;the first introducing an
Indian archer shooting at a stag, and the lower a
fort or castle with a ship at sea sailing towards it.
Dinwiddie was a good servant to the English Crown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
both in Barbadoes and Virginia, and is said, like most
successful people of his day, to be descended from an
ancient family, though his immediate ancestors were
Glasgow merchants. We are, however, not asked to
believe, and we should not, if we were, that the arms
are more ancient than Governor Dinwiddie himself,
or that they <i>originated</i> elsewhere than in his mercantile
brain, though they may have been legally
<i>granted</i> by the Scotch College of Arms. The plate
looks 'Scotch'&mdash;it is 'Chippendale,' and, I suspect,
was engraved in the mother-country by a Scotch
engraver. We may date it about 1750.</p>

<p>There are, of course, some American book-plates
specially interesting from their possessors, and foremost
amongst them is that of George Washington.
For its description I cannot do better than quote
Mr. Allen: 'The arms are displayed upon a shield
of the usual shell-like form, and the sprays and rose-branches
of this style [Chippendale] are used in the
ornamentation of the sides of the escutcheon. The
motto, <i>Exitus acta probat</i>, is given upon its ribbon
at the base of the shield, and the name is engraved,
in script, on the bracket at the bottom of the design.
In general appearance the plate is like scores of
Chippendale plates of the period.' I am sorry to
take, somewhat, from the interest which attaches
to this book-plate, by saying that, as I look more
closely into it and study the details of its ornamentation
and its execution, I am convinced it was engraved
in England and not in America; it must therefore be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of an earlier date than that attributed to it. I do not
think it is subsequent to 1760. Of course there is a
forgery of this plate, though it was prepared, not
because of the value of the book-plate, but to sell a
number of books which were said to have belonged
to George Washington himself, and to have been
captured in Virginia. The fraud was, however, discovered.
No doubt these forgeries are now palmed
off as the great man's book-plate. Mr. Lichtenstein's
words about the real book-plate and the sham
are therefore important:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Original examples are noticeable for their sharp
black impressions on dampened plate paper of a
buff colour mellowed by age. Those of the imitation
are printed from a plate which has the appearance
of having seen considerable wear; besides being
printed on a dry paper of a thin quality, and a
bluish colour; by its modern appearance it is easily
recognised, the engraving of the name being poorly
done.'</p>

<p>I do not know if a series of 'Presidents'' book-plates
could be shown to exist, but Washington's
successor, John Adams, certainly used one, introducing
into it a certain number of national emblems.
The American eagle with outspread wings overshadows
the whole design.</p>

<p>Of American women, in the early days of independence,
only one is known to have used a
book-plate. This lady was Elizabeth Gr&aelig;me, the
youngest child of Dr. Thomas Gr&aelig;me, member of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the Provincial Council, and in other ways a distinguished
and wealthy citizen, who owned Gr&aelig;me
Park, an estate lying some twenty miles from Philadelphia.
Elizabeth was born in 1737. At seventeen
she was engaged to be married, but her engagement
was suddenly&mdash;why, we learn not&mdash;broken off.
To divert her mind, she set to work to translate
<i>T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</i>. She carried out the task, but it was
never published, and lies to-day, as she wrote it, in
the Philadelphia Museum. Her next engagement
was to a man ten years her junior&mdash;a Mr. Ferguson;
him she married, but, her husband taking the Crown's
part, they separated. By the time of her death, in
1801, she had grown needy, despite the fact that
she received money from her literary productions,
which were numerous. Though evidently a staunch
Republican, she was the bearer of the famous letter
from the Rev. Jacob Duch&eacute; to Washington, in which
the writer begged his correspondent to return 'to
his allegiance to the King.' The book-plate,
which is, in every way, curious and interesting, is
Armorial.</p>

<p>An interesting point about American book-plates&mdash;which
illustrates a distinctive feature in social life
there&mdash;is the existence of a large number belonging
to Friendly Societies, Mutual Improvement Societies,
and institutions akin to them; for the books forming
the libraries of these bodies contain some of the
most curious and characteristic American book-plates.
Amongst the number may be mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
those of the New York Society Library, the Farmington
Library, the Hasty Pudding Society and
the Porcellian Club in Harvard College, the Linonian
Society and the Brothers of Unity in Yale, and the
Social Friends in Dartmouth College.</p>

<p>None of these are particularly early, indeed the
majority must be dated after the establishment of
independence, but they are well worthy of study.
Allegory runs wild in the book-plates&mdash;there are three
mentioned by Mr. Dexter Allen&mdash;of the first-named
Society, and Minerva is prominent in all. Let me
endeavour to describe two, both the work of Maverick.
In one she hands a volume of the Society's Library
to an Indian, whose attitude in receiving it suggests
that he had never seen a book before; in which case
its contents cannot have done him much good. In
the other she has just descended from Olympus,
entered the library, and seized a volume from the
book-shelf, which she presents to an apparently more
appreciative red-skin. I say appreciative, for in
return he hands the goddess his tomahawk. Minerva
with a tomahawk! Can anything be more delightfully
absurd?</p>

<p>One might go on with many pages of these descriptions,
but enough has been said to show the burlesque
spirit in which allegory is treated, doubtless quite
unintentionally, on American Society book-plates. In
that fact lies much of their interest. More happy
in conception and execution is the homelier design
appearing on the book-plate of the Village Library<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
in Farmington, which, if not a beautiful piece of
engraving, is at least free from grotesqueness.</p>

<p>'In this,' says Mr. Allen, 'we see the interior of a
room in which a young lady patron of the library is
storing her mind with those choice axioms which, if
put in practice, far exceed the attractiveness of mere
personal beauty; so says the couplet beneath the
picture:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
'Beauties in vain, their pretty eyes may roll;<br />
Charms strike the sense, but merit wins the soul.<br />
</div>

<p>A writer in the <i>Ex Libris Journal</i> points out that,
after the Revolution, till about the year 1810, there
were scarcely any American armorial book-plates.
Perhaps one of the earliest is that of 'Samuel Elam,
Rhode Island,' which appears to have been engraved
about 1800. It is 'Pictorial' in style, and shows a
shield, bearing arms, resting against a tree-stump,
with a landscape background. The majority of
American book-plate possessors, from 1810 until the
fashion of using a book-plate became common some
little time back, seem to have been members of the
legal profession.</p>

<p>During the last few years many American book-plates
have been as wild and meaningless in design
as the majority of those recently produced in
England; although, as Mr. Allen's illustrations show
us, a few truly artistic and appropriate examples
have appeared. One modern book-plate from
across the Atlantic is sure to attract English eyes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
for the owner's works are read as eagerly, and appreciated
as fully, here as in the States,&mdash;I mean that of
'Oliver Wendell Holmes.' This, too, is appropriate
for the man, consisting simply of a motto-scroll, on
which is written <i>Per Ampliora ad Altiora</i>, and a
nautilus&mdash;'the ship of pearl,' as he calls it; 'the
venturous bark that flings</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>INSCRIPTIONS ON BOOK-PLATES IN CONDEMNATION
OF BOOK-STEALING OR BOOK-SPOILING,
AND IN PRAISE OF STUDY</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">I propose</span> now to speak about the inscriptions on
book-plates, and I will divide them as follows:&mdash;(1)
Sentiments in condemnation of book-stealing or
book-spoiling; (2) sentiments in praise of books
or of study; and (3) personal particulars of the
owner of the book-plate, which last class shall receive
attention in a separate chapter. In all three cases
illustrations may be appropriately drawn both from
English and foreign examples.</div>

<p>Let me begin by calling the reader's attention to
the fact, which I commented upon in my first chapter,
that in nearly all inscriptions on book-plates it is the
volume in which the book-plate is placed, and not
the book-plate itself, that is spokesman. Take the
inscription on one of the earliest examples: 'Liber
Bilibaldi Pirckheimer, Sibi et amicis.' Bilibald Pirckheimer's
book for himself and his friends! Here is an
amiable intention; but the plan did not work, and we
do not find the sentiment often repeated. In the good
jurist's day printed books were not numerous, and
they were costly. Then might a man be reasonably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
regarded as a dog in the manger, who shut the door
of his bookcase against those anxious to benefit
by the work of the printing-press; then mankind at
large had not demonstrated the fact that general
morality does not extend to returning borrowed
books. Hence, I say, it was that on this early book-plate
we have the expression 'Sibi et amicis.'</p>

<p>School-boys&mdash;and I dare say, if one could only
learn the truth in such matters, school-girls too&mdash;have
a habit of inscribing their school-books with
verses, denouncing in decidedly forcible language
the school-fellow who steals&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> borrows and forgets
to return&mdash;any particular volume, and at the end of
these verses is depicted a gallows from which hangs
the lifeless body of the thief. When did school-boys
first thus protect their possessions? Few school-books
survive for use by many successive generations,
so we have no means of answering the question
satisfactorily; but in a book&mdash;not a school-book&mdash;published
in 1540, there are written (so a correspondent
of <i>Notes and Queries</i> informs us), in writing
more than three centuries old, these lines below the
owner's signature:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
'My Master's name above you se,<br />
Take heede therefore you steale not mee;<br />
For if you doe, without delay<br />
Your necke ... for me shall pay.<br />
Looke doune below and you shal see<br />
The picture of the gallowstree;<br />
Take heede therefore of thys in time,<br />
Lest on this tree you highly clime.'<br /><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">[Drawing of the gallows.]</span><br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>So the school-boy's doggerel is at least founded on
an ancient model, which we have quoted, though not
actually appearing on a book-plate, because it was
clearly intended to do duty as one.</div>

<p>Of exactly the same date is a very pompous
declaration, on a German book-plate, of a donor's
intention that certain volumes given by him should
remain for ever in the library to which they are
presented. The owner of the book-plate was John
Faber, Bishop of Vienna, who died in 1541, and who, in
the previous year, presented his books to the College
of St. Nicholas in that city. Here is a translation
given by Lord De Tabley, in which mark how in
kingly fashion the bishop refers to himself as 'we':&mdash;</p>

<p>'This book was bought by us, Dr. John Faber,
Bishop of Vienna, and assistant in the Government of
the New State, both as councillor and confessor to the
most glorious, clement, and pious Ferdinand, King of
the Romans, Hungary, and Bohemia, and Archduke
of Austria. And since, indeed, that money (which
purchased this volume) did not arise from the revenues
and properties of our diocese, but from our own most
honest labours in other directions. And therefore it
is free to us to give or bequeath the book to whomsoever
we please. We accordingly present it to our
College of St. Nicholas. And we ordain that this
volume shall remain there for ever for the use of the
students, according to our order and decree. Done
in our Episcopal Court at Vienna, on the first day of
September in the year of Grace 1540.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 215px;"><a id="LILIENTHAL"></a>
<img src="images/i_181.jpg" width="215" height="300" alt="Thomas Lilienthal's" />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Faber was famous for his orthodoxy and his
fervour in enforcing it; so much so, that he earned
for himself the title <i>Malleus hereticorum</i>. He does
not trust himself to express his opinion of the too
eager student who should take to himself a volume
from amongst these books; which is perhaps well.</p>

<p>More polite than the English verses of 1540, and
therefore not half so serviceable, are those printed
on an actual book-plate, by which Andrew Hedio, a
K&ouml;nigsberg professor of philosophy, who lived about
the middle of the seventeenth century, sought to
insure the safe return to his library of any volume
which was out on loan. The arms of Hedio&mdash;the
head and shoulders of an old bearded man in a fish-tailed
nightcap&mdash;appear on the book-plate, and below,
supposed to be spoken by the volume, are Latin
verses, which in free translation may be rendered:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
'By him who bought me for his own,<br />
I'm lent for reading leaf by leaf;<br />
If honest, you'll return the loan,<br />
If you retain me, you're a thief.'<br />
</div>

<p>If you turn back to <a href="#Page_123">p. 123</a> and look at the book-plate
of Speratus, you will see that he had expressed
very much this sentiment more than a century before.</p>

<p>It is not till the beginning of the eighteenth century
that we find any decided expression of possession
on an English book-plate. Then it occurs on
that of John Reilly (described on <a href="#Page_53">p. 53</a>). At the
very bottom of the design is printed: 'Clamabunt
omnes te, liber, esse meum.' Here you see it is John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Reilly himself and not his book that speaks. It is a
mild and decidedly gentlemanly way of expressing
ownership, free from threats for not returning the
volume; indeed, hardly contemplating the possibility
of so dishonest an act.</p>

<p>About the same date as Reilly's book-plate is a
very graceful German one, executed for Michael
Lilienthal (figured on <a href="#Page_165">p. 165</a>). It shows us a group
of growing lilies, around which bees are hovering
or tasting their sweetness, and below&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
'Use the book, but let no one misuse it;<br />
The bee does not stain the lilies, but only touches them.'<br />
</div>

<p>From this graceful book-plate and the pleasantry of
its inscription, we turn to a heavy declamatory sentence,
devised, <i>circa</i> 1730, by the librarian of the Benedictine
monastery of Wessenbrun, in Bavaria, for the books in
his charge to speak when a theft had been actually
committed or was in contemplation: 'I am the rightful
possession of the Cloister of Wessenbrun. Ho
there! Restore me to my master, so right demands!'</p>

<p>Sherlock Willis, whose book-plate&mdash;a decided
'Chippendale'&mdash;is dated in 1756, flies to Scripture
for his aid against immoral borrowers, and places
on his book-plate the familiar quotation from the
37th Psalm: 'The ungodly borroweth, and payeth
not again.' Various other English book-plates bear
the same quotation, or some other taken from the
Bible. On that in use at the Parochial Library of
Tadcaster, which shows us St. John in the isle of
Patmos receiving from the angel the book which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
was to eat, we read: 'Accipe librum et devora
illum' (Rev. x. 9); advice which it was not, we
may presume, intended that the borrower should
follow literally.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 450px;"><a id="GARRICK"></a>
<img src="images/i_185.jpg" width="450" height="325" alt="Garrick's" />
</div>
<p>There is something very businesslike and to the
point about the inscription on the book-plate of
Charles Ferdinand Hommeau, which is dated six
years after that of Sherlock Willis. The inscription
reads in translation: 'If you do not return the loan
within fourteen days, or do not keep it carefully, on
another occasion [when you ask to borrow it or some
other book] I shall say I have not got it.' So M.
Hommeau will not mind telling a lie to protect
his library; and what is more, does not mind telling
the world of his intention to do so. Truly he was an
honest liar.</p>

<p>David Garrick (whose book-plate is figured opposite)
selected as an appropriate quotation for
his book-plate the following, taken from the fourth
volume of <i>Menagiana:</i>&mdash;'La premi&egrave;re chose qu'on doit
faire quand on a emprunt&eacute; un livre, c'est de le lire
afin de pouvoir le rendre plut&ocirc;t.' Very good advice,
no doubt; but I wonder if 'Davy' was careful enough
to confine his loans to those who would follow it?
This reminds me of a very nicely put passage of
Lord De Tabley's, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of the subject of book-borrowing
in general:&mdash;</p>



<p>'Now this batch of mottoes raises the point, whether
valuable books should be lent to persons who treat
volumes like coal scuttles; who perpetrate such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a><br /><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
atrocities as moistening their thumbs to turn a page
over; who hold a fine binding before a roaring fire?
who, <i>horribile dictu</i>, read at breakfast, and use, as
a book-marker, the butter-knife. Ought Garrick to
have lent the cream of his Shakespeare quartos to
slovenly and mole-eyed Samuel Johnson? We think
emphatically not! Many full-grown folks have no
more idea of handling a book than has a school-boy.'</p>

<p>So far the 'caveats' on book-plates have been
either original compositions or quotations, specially
selected by the owner; but, as time went on, people
did not trouble to compose their own verses or
inscriptions, or to hunt up appropriate quotations.
The same lines or words appear fastened beneath,
or printed upon, the book-plates of many different
persons; in the latter case the book-plate is generally
little more than a name ticket. Here is one, composed
early in this century, which could be bought
of C. Talbot, at 174 Tooley Street, and on it the
purchaser could write his name before affixing it in
his volumes:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
'THIS BOOK<br />

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Keep cleanly, return duly,</span><br />

</div>

<p>Of about the same date is another little effusion,
which clearly does not contemplate the purchaser
being the possessor of a <i>unique</i> volume, or of one for
any cause irreplaceable, if lost:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
'THIS BOOK BELONGS TO<br />
</div><div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">.&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp;  .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .</span><br />

Nor lend it to each idle friend in the town;<br />
Return it when read, or, if lost, please supply<br />

</div>

<p>In these last quoted examples are certainly many
stipulations, but they are as nought when compared
with what we find on the book-plate of the Cavalier
Francesco Vargas Macciucca, who was in the habit
of pasting on the fly-leaf of the book, opposite his
book-plate, <i>fifteen</i> rules, written in Latin, to be observed
by those who borrowed books from his library.
If he enforced them, he can have been seldom troubled
with a borrower!</p>

<p>On the face of them,&mdash;since most of them have a
blank space left for the owner's name, etc.,&mdash;these
poetic or prosaic threats against book-stealers and
the ill-usage of books do not pretend to be the compositions
of those that used them. Jones or Brown
went to the nearest stationer or bookseller, and purchased
his admonitions all ready composed. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
even after the introduction of ready-made admonitions,
we find the man of independent mind rebelling
against saving his library from spoliation by anybody's
words save his own. Such a person was Mr.
Charles Clark, of Great Totham Hall, near Witham,
in Essex, who can at least claim originality for his
composition, which, if lengthy, has occasional gleams
of humour. Here it is:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
'A PLEADER TO THE NEEDER WHEN<br />

As all, my friend, through wily knaves, full often suffer wrongs,<br />

<p>A certain Cheshire clergyman, who died not very
long since, sought euphony in a string of commands
to intending borrowers, which he had printed on his
book-plate; 'Borrow bravely; Keep carefully; Peruse
patiently; Return righteously.' What a pity he did
not spell 'carefully' with a 'k' whilst he was about it!</p>

<p>The Plymouth architect and author, George Wightwick,
or, as he evidently pronounced it, <i>Witick</i>, used
to affix in his books:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
'To whomsoever this book I <i>lend</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I <i>give</i> one word&mdash;no more;</span><br />
They who to <i>borrow</i> condescend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should graciously <i>restore</i>.</span><br />
And whosoe'er this book should find<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Be't trunk-maker or critick),</span><br />
I'll thank him if he'll bear in mind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That it is mine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;"><span class="smcap">George Wightwick</span>.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>See, too, how a certain Mr. Charles Woodward
protected, or thought he protected, the volumes
which good nature may have prompted him to lend.
His plate shows an opened volume, on one page of
which is written: 'Narrative&mdash;promising to send me
home at the appointed time. Finis.' Evidently Mr.
Woodward, like the honest liar before mentioned,
was not a man to lend his volumes for an indefinite
period.</p>

<p>Having quoted various recent English examples
of this kind, we are in duty bound to cite some from
other component parts of the United Kingdom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the name 'H. Macdonald' we find:</p>

<div class='poem'>
'Tear not, nor soil not;<br />
Read all, but spoil not.'<br />
</div>

<blockquote><p>'A good book is a good friend; he who would injure the one
deserves not the respect of the other.'</p></blockquote>

<p>There is something almost pathetic in the exclamation
which Mr. John Marks makes his volumes utter:
'Gentle reader, take me home; I belong to John
Marks, 20 Cook Street, Cork'; and then the evil-minded
borrower is reminded of the scriptural condemnation
of his kind by reference to 'Psalm xxxvii.
ver. 21.' Before this comes&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
'ADVICE FOR THE MILLION<br />
</div><div class='poem'>
Neither a borrower or a lender be,<br />
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,<br />

</div>

<p>We may presume from this that Mr. John Marks
tried to be funny, and from his composition getting
into print he may flatter himself that he succeeded.</p>

<p>One more example of these warnings to borrowers
and we have done with the subject. Lord De Tabley
fixes the date of it as 1820, but surely it must be
the composition of some eleventh century reprobate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
who on his death-bed richly endowed a neighbouring
monastery, and threatened any one who should ever
disturb his endowment. The words appear on the
book-plate of O. M[oore], and they read in translation:
'If any one steals this book, and with furtive
hand carries it off, let him go to the foul waves of
Acheron, never to return.'</p>

<p>Now, let us look at some of the eulogies of books
or of study which are found on book-plates. These
do not appear until a much later date. The text on
Pirckheimer's book-plate, '<i>The fear of the Lord is
the beginning of wisdom</i>,' can hardly be called one
in praise of study, though it is a wholesome truth
that should be borne in mind by every student.
Indeed, we have to pass over more than two centuries
after the invention of book-plates before one which,
in the inscription upon it, yields an example of the
kind now under consideration. This appears at last
in 1697, in a sentiment expressed by an Austrian
lawyer, John Seyringer by name. Here it is:</p>

<div class='poem'>
'He that would learn without the aid of books<br />
Draws water in a sieve from running brooks.'<br />
</div>

<p>We have again to pass over many years for our
next example. Peter de Maridat, who was, he tells
us, a senator in the Great Council of Louis <span class='small'>XIV.</span> of
France, used for a book-plate, which may therefore
be dated before 1715, the figure of a negro, who
stands with one hand resting on a shield of arms, and
holds in the other a pair of scales. The arms on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the shield are azure, a cross argent, and below is
written:</p>

<div class='poem'>
'Inde cruce hinc trutina armatus regique deoque<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Milito, Disco meis h&aelig;c duo nempe libris,'</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>which may be construed: 'Armed on one side with
the cross [the cross on the shield], and on the other
with the pair of scales, I fight for my king and for
my God. These two things I indeed learn from
my books,' <i>libris;</i> but <i>libris</i> may also be translated
'balances,' and herein is the pun!</div>

<p>Taking them chronologically, our next examples
are on English book-plates; one is dated 1730, and
the other evidently belongs to the same period. On
the first, the Rev. John Lloyd writes: 'Animus si
&aelig;quus, quod petis hic est'; and on the other, Thomas
Robinson, a Fellow of Merton, quotes from Cicero:
'Delectant domi non impediunt foris.' Perhaps
'Herbert Jacob, Esq. of St. Stephen's, in Kent,' had
a generally troublesome wife, who did not penetrate
the sacred region of his library; however it may
have been, he placed on his book-plate, <i>circa</i> 1740:
'Otium cum libris,' a sentiment expressed in a great
variety of ways on later book-plates.</p>

<p>Some ten years later than the last example is the
book-plate of a German cleric, Gottfried Balthazar
Scharff, Archdeacon of Schweidnitz, a town in Prussian
Silesia, on which his books are praised in some not
ungraceful verses; in these the owner asks divine help
in understanding aright the teaching of his volumes.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>On the Flemish book-plate of Lewis Bosch (spoken
of elsewhere in this volume, <a href="#Page_218">p. 218</a>), we read beneath
the representation of the prelate's library, in which
he is shown hard at work among his books: 'A
hunt in such a forest never wearies.' The allusion
to a forest of books recalls the motto on the much
later English book-plate of Mary Berry. On this
is depicted a wild strawberry plant, its fruit half
hidden by leaves, and below is written, 'Inter folia
fructus.' Probably Miss Berry, besides alluding to
the fruit of knowledge which she found amongst the
leaves of her books, intended a mild play upon the
strawberry and her own family name.</p>

<p>Besides these, a host of further mottoes in praise
of books or about books are to be met with. Some
recommend the collection of as large a library as
possible; others point out that the mind is distracted
by a multitude of books; some advocate the careful
handling of a volume, even at the expense of not
getting so well acquainted with its contents; whilst
others tell us that well-thumbed books are monuments
of the owner's industry and constant study.
Nor are the consoling powers of books forgotten.
On a very pretty rustic vignette, executed by Bonner
after Bewick, 'W. B. Chorley of Liverpool' has the
words: 'My books, the silent friends of joy and woe.'</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">How</span> much more communicative, in the matter of
personal particulars, are some people, upon their
book-plate, than others! What a contrast, for
instance, between the inscription on Walpole's book-plate&mdash;'Mr.
Horatio Walpole'&mdash;and that on one of
Pepys's, on which he styles himself 'Esquire,' and
states that he is of Brampton in Huntingtonshire,
'Secretary of the Admiralty of his Mat<sup>y</sup> King
Charles the Second,' and 'Descended of y<sup>e</sup> ancient
family of Pepys of Cottenham in Cambridgeshire.'</div>

<p>Of course Sam Pepys was a vain man&mdash;that we
all know; but the difference between the two inscriptions
has more to do with the fashion of the time than
with the characteristics of the two men. In enlarging
on his pedigree, social position, and secretaryship to
the Admiralty, Pepys was only following the custom
of his day. There are many examples of similar inscriptions
on book-plates contemporary with Pepys's:&mdash;'Charles
Pitfeild of Hoxton, in the Parish of St.
Leonards, Shoreditch, in Middlesex, Esq<sup>r.,</sup> descended
of the ancient family of the Pitfeilds of Symsbury
in Dorsetshire, and is now married to Winifred,
one of the daughters and C&oelig;heyrs of John Adderley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of Coton in Stafordshire, Esq<sup>r.</sup>' And again:&mdash;'S<sup>r</sup>.
Henry Hunloke of Wingerworth, in Derbyshire,
Bart. In y<sup>e</sup> escocheon of pretence is y<sup>e</sup> Armes of
Katherine his Lady, who was sole daughter and heyre
of Francis Tyrwhit of Kettleby, in Lincolnshire,
Esq<sup>e</sup>, y<sup>e</sup> last of y<sup>e</sup> Eldest branch of y<sup>t</sup> great and
ancient family.' Equally proud of his ancestry is
'Thomas Windham of Sale in Devonshire, Esq<sup>r.,</sup>
one of the Grooms of his Majesties Bed-chamber,
third son of S<sup>r</sup> Edmund Windham of Cathanger in
Somersetshire, Kt., Marshall of his Majesties most
Hon<sup>ble</sup> household,' who concludes the inscription on
his book-plate by telling us that he was 'lineally
descended from the antient family of the Windhams
of Crown-Thorpe, in the County of Norfolk.'</p>

<p>But this habit of expressing pride in ancestry,
though it became less frequent, certainly survived
Pepys's time. Mr. J. Paul Rylands, F.S.A., has a
copy of the <i>Eikon Basilike</i>, printed in 1649, on
the title-page of which is written, 'Dan. Mercator.'
Within the book is an armorial book-plate engraved
in the Jacobean style, and, since it belonged to a
man born in 1640, one of the early examples of
that style. The owner was the eminent mathematician,
Nicholas Mercator, who was born at
Holstein, and afterwards settled in England, where
his mathematical ability was recognised by his
election as a Fellow of the Royal Society. Nicholas
was proud of his ancestors' efforts in the cause of
Protestantism, and also wished his English friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
to be aware of them; he therefore inscribes his
book-plate, 'Nicholas Mercator, a Descendant of the
Kauffmans of Prague, in Bohemia, Coadjutors with
Luther in the Reformation.'</p>

<p>On the Continent, lengthy eulogies of ancestors are
common, and they commence at an early date. Here
is one, which is also a sigh for the purity of nobility
in ages past. It is uttered, in 1565, by John Giles
Kn&ouml;ringen, who writes, below his shield of arms,
given in colour:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
'These are the famed insignia of my sires,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which in their proper colour you may see;</span><br />
Not bribes, as is the fashion in these days,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But virtue, raised them to nobility.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>It is, however, most frequently in an enumeration
of his offices or degrees that the owner of a book-plate
allows himself to get wordy. Let us take, for
instance, the already mentioned book-plate of Sir
Edward Dering (see <a href="#Page_31">pp. 31</a>, <a href="#Page_32">32</a>), which bears date
1630, and displays a shield of twenty coats of arms;
it has a proportionately impressive description of Sir
Edward's many offices&mdash;Lieutenant of Dover Castle,
Vice-Chancellor, and Vice-Admiral of the Cinque
Ports, etc. Sir Robert Southwell, Knight, tells us
that he is 'one of the Clerkes attending His Majesty
King Charles the Second in his most Honourable
Privy Councell, etc.'</p>

<p>William Wharton, who was killed in a duel, in
1689, calls himself 'fourth son to the Right Honourable
Philip Lord Wharton of Wharton, in Westmoreland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
by Ann, Daughter to William Carr, of
Fernihast, in Scotland, Esq<sup>r.,</sup> one of the Groome (<i>sic</i>)
of the Bedchamber to King James'; whilst Randolph
Egerton, in the inscription on his book-plate, recalls
the time when the unhappy Duke of Monmouth was
yet a trusted officer in the royal army: 'Randolph
Egerton of Betley, in Staford Shire, Esquire, Lieutenant
of his Majestyes own Troop of Guard, under
the comand of his Grace James Duke of Monmouth,
etc.'</p>

<p>The book-plates of Thomas, Earl of Wentworth,
contain a curiously lengthy enumeration of the
offices enjoyed by that distinguished soldier and
diplomatist, who, at a critical time, steered his
country through a great many difficulties. The first
is dated in 1698, and on it the owner describes himself
as 'The Right Honourable Thomas Wentworth,
Baron of Raby, and Colonell of his Maiesties owne
Royall Reg<sup>mt</sup> of Dragoons, 1698.' In 1703 Wentworth
was sent as envoy to Berlin, and two years later
was advanced to the post of ambassador. On this
appointment he had a second book-plate engraved,
bearing the following inscription:&mdash;'His Excellency
The R<sup>t</sup> Hon<sup>ble</sup> Tho. Wentworth, Lord Raby, Peer of
England, Coll<sup>o</sup> of her Ma<sup>tys</sup> Royal Reg<sup>t</sup> of Dragoons,
Lieu<sup>t</sup> General of all her Ma<sup>tys</sup> Forces &amp; her Ma<sup>tys</sup>
Embassador Extra<sup>ry</sup> to y<sup>e</sup> King of Prussia, 1705;'&mdash;size
4 &times; 3. On the face of it, this is foreign work,
and the expression 'Peer of England' could hardly
have been put on it by an English engraver.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Wentworth's later diplomatic post has been made
famous by Swift's allusion to it, in reference to his
being associated with Mat Prior. 'Wentworth,' says
the Dean, 'is as proud as hell, and how he will bear
one of Prior's mean birth on an equal character with
him I know not.' Proud as hell, was he? Well, he
certainly was proud of his advance in title and his
many high offices, all of which he sets out in his
third and last book-plate, also, I think, foreign
work, dated in 1712. Here is the inscription: 'His
Excellency the Right Honourable Thomas Earl of
Strafford, Viscount Wentworth of Wentworth Woodhouse,
and of Stainborough, Baron of Raby, Newmarch,
and Oversley, Her Majesty's Ambassador
Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the States
General of y<sup>e</sup> United Provinces, and also at the
Congress of Utrecht; Colonel of Her Majesty's own
Royal Regiment of Dragoons, Lieutenant-General of
all Her Forces; First Lord of the Admiraltry (<i>sic</i>)
of Great Britain and Ireland; one of the Lords of
Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council; and
Knight of the Most Noble Order of y<sup>e</sup> Garter.' On
the accession of George <span class='small'>I.</span>, an attempt was made to
impeach this busy Lord, but it failed, and he retired
into private life for the rest of his days. His
memoirs, published a few years back by Mr. Cartwright,
F.S.A., give an excellent picture of life at the
time he lived.</p>

<p>Some book-plate owners, not boastful of their
titles, let us into their confidences as to their place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
of birth, age, and the like. The German book-plate,
dated in 1618, of John Vennitzer, a knife-smith or
cutler by trade, tells us that he was born at Nuremberg,
at 22 minutes past 5 in the afternoon on the
14th day of May, 1565. Vennitzer made money by
his trade, and founded the Library of St. Lawrence in
his native city; perhaps the date on the book-plate
is that of the foundation of the library. No doubt,
as Lord De Tabley remarks, the cutler conscientiously
believed that the condition of his whole life depended
on the particular moment at which he entered the
world; for he was probably well versed in the
mysteries of horoscopy.</p>

<p>'John Collet' makes us really quite familiar with
all his relations, and with his own religious feelings.
His book-plate&mdash;it is only a printed label&mdash;reads:
'Johannes Collet filius Thom&aelig; Collet. Pater Thom&aelig;,
Gulielmi, ac Johannis, omnium superstes. Natus
quarto junii, 1633. Denasciturus quando Deo visum
fuerit; interim hujus proprietarius John (<i>sic</i>) Collet.'</p>

<p>Even more obliging is 'Thomas Tertius Okey,
medicin&aelig; Professor, 1697.' He was, he tells us, 'great
grandson to William Okey (usually cal'd Okely) of
Church Norton, betwixt Gloucester and Tewxsbury,
gentelman; grandson to Thomas Primus Okey of
Church Norton, the Devizes and Taunton, Professor
of Theology; eldest son to Thomas Secundus Okey,
of the Devizes and London, Professor of Physick,
and father to Thomas Quartus Okey, of London,
gentelman. The above mentioned Thomas Tertius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Okey, Professor of Physick, now liveth in London
near the Bodys of his deceased relations.' Before
such details as these, even John Collet seems reticent.</p>

<p>Sir Philip Sydenham&mdash;whose peculiarities in the
matter of book-plates are elsewhere commented upon&mdash;in
one of his first examples, dated in 1699, tells us
his age: 'Sir Philip Sydenham, Bart., of Brympton in
Somerset, and M.A. of the University of Cambridge,
&AElig;ta. Su&aelig; 23.' Richard Towneley in 1702 does the
same. The inscription on his book-plate reads, as
we see by the frontispiece:</p>

<div class='poem2'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">'Ex libris Bibliothec&aelig;
Domestic&aelig; Richardi Towneley de Towneley In Agro Lancastrensi Armigeri Anno {&AElig;tatis: 73</span><br />
{Domini: 1702.'<br />
</div>

<p>One cannot help wondering why Mr. Towneley&mdash;the
owner, and in a great part the collector, of the
vast library with which the family name is connected&mdash;should
have waited till he was seventy-three years
of age to have a book-plate engraved. Some of the
volumes in that library had a curious stamp in silver
of the Towneley arms, with the date 1603 on their
bindings, but there does not seem to have been an
earlier book-plate. Richard Towneley died at York
in 1707. Besides being an astronomer and a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'mathematican'">mathematician</ins>,
he was a keen antiquary; and Thoresby,
the historian of Leeds, tells us of the pride with
which he showed him a wondrous and just completed
pedigree of the Towneley family, on the occasion of
their meeting during the year in which the book-plate
was engraved.</p>

<p>'John Fenwick of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Attorney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
at Law,' leaves us in ignorance as to his age at the
time his book-plate was engraved, because he does
not date it; but he states that he was 'born at
Hexham, 14th April 1787,' and 'married at Alnwick,
9th June 1814.'</p>

<p>One lady&mdash;and only one&mdash;lets us into what, with
those of her sex, is usually a secret. Isabel de
Menezes inscribes her book-plate by Bartolozzi (see
<a href="#Page_94">p. 94</a>), '&AElig;tatis 71 anno 1798.'</p>

<p>I have given, in this chapter, no foreign examples
of book-plates on which minute personal particulars
appear; but some of the examples of which I have
spoken elsewhere&mdash;notably the Flemish book-plate
of Count vander Noot&mdash;will show that they exist.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LADIES' BOOK-PLATES</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">There</span> seem to be really several good and logical
reasons why we should separate, for consideration by
themselves, the book-plates which have been used
by ladies. To mention two: there are certain differences
(such as the shape of the shield in which the
arms are borne) which, by the rigid laws of heraldry,
ought to appear on these book-plates when belonging
to a maid or widow; moreover, ladies' book-plates,
though sometimes mere printed labels, are generally
more fanciful in design than the majority of those
owned by the sterner sex.</div>

<p>The whole subject of ladies' book-plates has been so
exhaustively treated by Miss Norna Labouchere that
it need not take up much space in the present chapter.
When, however, in this work, Miss Labouchere asks
where are book-plates of the English feminine bibliophiles
of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth
centuries&mdash;Dame Juliana Berners, Margaret Roper,
Lady Jane Grey, Mary Stuart, and the ladies of Little
Gidding&mdash;the answer, I am afraid, is: they had none.
Had they possessed them, they would, in this book-plate-spying
age, have been discovered.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 420px;"><a id="BATH"></a>
<img src="images/i_203.jpg" width="420" height="425" alt="Bath's" />
<span class="caption">LADY BATH&#39;S BOOK-PLATE.</span>
</div>

<p>But, be it said to the credit of the ladies, some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a><br /><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
earliest dated English book-plates belonged to them.
It is true these are merely name-tickets, such as that
of Elizabeth Pindar, 1608, in the Bagford Collection,
kindly pointed out to me by Mr. W. Y. Fletcher;
but the fact of their existence deserves notice,
because it shows the readiness of the fair sex to lay
hold of a new fashion; and having a book-plate in
the early years of the seventeenth century was a new
fashion, at least in England.</p>

<p>The first Armorial ladies' book-plate is that of
the Countess-Dowager of Bath, already very fully described.
I will only add that readers who refer back
to what I have said about her matrimonial arrangements
(<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a>), will see that she is heraldically
accurate in not bearing her arms in a lozenge. The
laws of heraldry do not allow ladies, while married,
to place their arms in lozenge-shaped shields; and
this fact enables some feminine book-plate owners to
demonstrate the possession of a virtue which women
are often taxed with lacking&mdash;economy. Ladies
frequently made the same designs do duty as their
own book-plates which had served for their husbands.
But, according to Miss Labouchere, the husband sometimes
used his wife's book-plate; for the book-plates&mdash;identical,
save for the inscriptions&mdash;of the Duke and
Duchess of Beaufort, Lord and Lady Roos, and some
others, show, on examination, that the words indicative
of ownership by the lady have been erased, and over-engraved
by those indicative of possession by her lord.</p>

<p>The lozenge really looks very well on a book-plate;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and lends itself readily to the decoration usually bestowed
upon it. Take, for instance, that of Dame Anne
Margaretta Mason, dated in 1701. Her maiden name
was Long, and the shield shows us Mason impaling
Long. Lady Mason's is a fair sample of a lady's
book-plate of that date. The arms are contained in a
lozenge, set in a Jacobean frame, which is lined with
scale work, and adorned with ribbons and leafy sprays.
There is no motto-scroll, but the name bracket comes
up close to the base of the design (see also <a href="#Page_52">p. 52</a>).</p>

<p>Indeed it may be said that the Jacobean style of
ornamentation is that best suited to ladies' book-plates,
especially when the arms are depicted on a
lozenge-shaped shield. The book-plate of the 'Hon.
Anne North,' by Simon Gribelin, is another instance
to prove this. I do not think that Chippendale
decoration suits them at all, and, in the use of
ornaments of that style, Englishwomen were as immoderate
as Englishmen. Lady Lombe's book-plate,
designed in the later days of Chippendalism, is quite
appalling from its over-ornamentation. The wreath
of ribbon, or festoon, style of the close of the last
century is more suitable for ladies' book-plates, and
some very charming examples are known; equally
suitable, it seems to me, would have been the picture
or landscape style&mdash;the style in which, at the close
of the last century, Bewick, and some few other
English artists, were working with conspicuous
success, and it seems strange that the ladies of
Great Britain did not adopt it more extensively.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>When we come to modern times we find ladies
have run as wild as their lords over book-plates;
there is the same peculiarity, the same mysticism,
the same inappropriateness for book-plates in the
designs of many book-plates of <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> English
ladies. The few really artistic and appropriate
book-plates stand out in marked contrast in Miss
Labouchere's excellent little book, and amongst
them may be noted Lady Mayo's, designed in 1894
by Mr. Anning Bell, which shows us a musician and
a songstress within a frame composed of spring
flowers and the national emblem of Ireland.</p>

<p>But let us go back a little in date, and look at a
ladies' book-plate designed in the Allegoric style;
what more striking example could be found than
that furnished by George Vertue's charming piece
of work engraved for Lady Oxford?</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 437px;"><a id="MORTIMER"></a>
<img src="images/i_207.jpg" width="437" height="635" alt="Countess of Oxford and Mortimer's bookplate" />
</div>

<p>It represents the interior of the library either at
Brampton or Welbeck, probably the latter, which
was Lady Oxford's own inheritance. Through a
doorway, flanked by Corinthian columns, the curtain
in front of which is drawn back, we obtain a view of
a country house standing back in a well-kept park;
a river crossed by a three-arched bridge meanders
through this. But it is the occupants of the room
that call for most attention. The prominent figure
is that of Minerva, who has laid aside her arms,
and stands sandalled and helmeted. She is busily
engaged in instructing six cupids, who appear to be
industriously following her injunctions. One of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a><br /><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
is painting in oils, with an easel before him and a
palette on his thumb; the goddess with her left hand
points out some defect in his work, and apparently explains
how it may be remedied. Another cupid plays
the harp; two more sit on the frame of the design,
weaving flowing festoons; another, also on the frame,
near a celestial globe, copies the picture of a flute-playing
satyr which a sixth cupid holds in position.</p>

<p>On the frame which surrounds the picture sit two
figures&mdash;one of which is Mercury, with caduceus and
winged hat&mdash;who act as supporters to a medallion
bearing Lady Oxford's monogram; above is an urn,
and from the sides fall bunches of grapes. Below
the design is engraved 'Henrietta Cavendish Holles,
Oxford and Mortimer. Given me by'&mdash;and then
the donor's name and last two figures of the date,
filled in by Lady Oxford herself.</p>

<p>Lady Oxford was the sole heiress of John Holles,
last Duke of Newcastle of the Holles family, and was
the wife of Edward, second Earl of Oxford, son of
Queen Anne's minister, and the continuator and completor
of the Harleian collections. Vertue's love of
studying all kinds of antiquities brought him, at
an early date, into contact with Lord Oxford, who
proved one of his warmest patrons. The artist himself
speaks of 'the Earl's generous and unparalleled
encouragement of my undertakings.' Harley would
take his friend with him on his various 'hunting'
tours in England, getting him to sketch the numerous
objects of interest that they came across. No wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
that the Earl's death, in 1741, was a heavy loss, in
every way, to George Vertue.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that there is no trace of heraldry
in this remarkable book-plate. Book-plates free from
anything armorial were not the rule in England in
1730, and Vertue was certainly proficient in heraldic
engraving, or ought to have been so, since his earliest
task in life was engraving coats of arms on plate, and
his second engagement was with Michael Vandergucht,
who, we know, executed a good deal of armorial
work. It is probable, therefore, that the idea of the
book-plate was Lady Oxford's own.</p>

<p>From this delightful specimen of a lady's book-plate
in which heraldry is entirely absent, we may
appropriately turn our attention to two examples
which combine heraldry with a fanciful design&mdash;the
book-plates of Lady Pomfret and the Honourable
Mrs. Damer. The first of these is that which 'S. W.,'
probably Samuel Wale, the Royal Academician, engraved
for 'The R<sup>t</sup> Hon<sup>ble</sup> Henrietta Louisa Jeffreys,
Countess of Pomfret, Lady of the Bed-chamber to
Queen Caroline,' and is a very unusual piece of
work, both in shape, design, and heraldry. There
is a clear indication of 'Chippendaleism' about the
shield and sprays of flowers and leaves, which is certainly
curious in view of what we must consider the
approximate date of the book-plate; but the arms are
in a Jacobean frame, which stands in a garden. On
one side we have a cupid bearing aloft the lady's
family crest, and on the other the husband's crest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
helmet, situated just within the opening of a tent.
Lady Pomfret was the granddaughter of James <span class='small'>II.</span>'s
infamous Lord Chancellor. She married Lord Pomfret
in 1720, and was Lady of the Bed-chamber to
Queen Caroline from 1713 to 1737, so that we are
enabled to fix the date of this plate within seventeen
years, indeed, probably within four years, for she had
a less ambitious, and no doubt earlier, book-plate
engraved for her, which bears the date 1733.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the book-plate of 'Selina,
Countess of Huntingdon,' forms a striking contrast
to that last described. Here we have a plain representation
of a coat of arms in a lozenge, and
supported in the orthodox manner. No cupids or
other vanities intrude themselves into this sombre
and coarsely executed work, which may be dated,
after the owner became a widow, in 1746, and therefore,
after her 'call'&mdash;which is, I believe, the correct
expression for a sudden conversion to the form of
religion she embraced.</p>

<p>Probably of about the same date as Lady Huntingdon's
book-plate is that of another famous woman
of her day, Lady Betty Germain, about whom Swift
has plenty to say in his <i>Journal to Stella</i>. On this
book-plate a somewhat funereal effect is produced
by the dark background, against which is the lozenge
containing the arms Berkeley impaling Germain; but
the ornamentation of the lozenge, of the name-scroll,
and of the frame enclosing the design, is light and
elegant. Poor Lady Betty! she had a good deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to live down: her girlhood had not been so moral
as it might have been, and the Duchess of Marlborough
did her best to make her friend's misfortunes
as public as possible. But for all that, Elizabeth
Berkeley made a good match in point of money,
marrying&mdash;as his second wife&mdash;Sir John Germain, a
soldier of fortune and repute. He left her a widow in
1718, with Drayton as her home and a vast fortune.
Her widowhood lasted very nearly fifty years, during
which she gave away large sums in charity, as well
as spending them on amassing curios: these, in 1763,
Walpole went to look at, and admired.</p>

<p>But we have been digressing, and have not <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'y  '">yet</ins>
spoken about the second of the two book-plates just
now mentioned, that of the Hon. Mrs. Damer, which,
in design and execution, certainly surpasses any ladies'
book-plate yet noticed; it is really a beautiful picture.
First let me speak of Mrs. Damer and her surroundings;
her book-plate becomes the more interesting as
we call these to mind. The daughter of Field-Marshal
Henry Seymour Conway, she made for herself, at
an early age, a name, both in England and Italy, as
an accomplished sculptress. From infancy&mdash;she was
born in 1749&mdash;she was the pet of Horace Walpole,
and throughout her life his intimate friend, living,
after her husband's<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> suicide, close to him at Strawberry
Hill, which he bequeathed to her by his will,
and where, by the way, the work of her artistic fingers
might be seen in profusion. Friends of herself and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Walpole were Robert Berry and his daughters Mary
and Agnes&mdash;'my twin wives,' Walpole calls them.
Mrs. Damer's book-plate is the work of the latter of
these two ladies&mdash;Walpole's 'sweet lamb, Agnes.' It
shows us a kneeling female figure, pointing to a newly-cut
inscription on a block of stone, 'Anna Damer';<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
above is a shield bearing the arms of Damer, with
those of Seymour-Conway on an escutcheon of pretence,
and on the right and left of this are elegantly
drawn dogs. The work was engraved by Francis
Legat, and is dated '1793.' Miss Mary Berry's book-plate
has been already spoken of (<a href="#Page_177">p. 177</a>).</p>

<p>As an illustration to this chapter on ladies' book-plates,
I have taken one which is both artistic and
interesting, from the fact that it shows us&mdash;in the
figure contemplating the bust&mdash;what is presumably
a picture of the owner. I fear, however, that proof of
its authenticity as a likeness sufficient to allow of its
incorporation as a 'Portrait' book-plate (see <a href="#Page_216">pp. 216-220</a>)
will not be forthcoming; but whether it is one
or not, it is certainly a pleasing book-plate. Frances
Anne Acland, the owner, was born in 1736, became
the wife of Richard Hoare of Barne Elms in 1761
and thus stepmother to Richard Colt Hoare, the
future antiquary and the historian of Wiltshire; she
died in the year 1800, and was buried at Beckenham.</p>

</div>

<p>But all that has been said, so far, concerns the
book-plates of English women. Foreign dames of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a><br /><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
various nationalities, and our feminine cousins across
the Atlantic (see <a href="#Page_150">p. 150</a>), have made a very generous
use of these marks of book-possession. French
women of the eighteenth century have, as the reader
of Miss Labouchere's interesting pages on this part of
her subject will see, for the most part, used book-stamps,
many of the most beautiful French bindings
gaining an additional interest and beauty from the
coats of arms of their fair owners impressed upon
them. There are, however, a fairly large number of
book-plates known which have belonged to French
women, or, at all events, to women resident in France,
and amongst them one to which attaches pathetic
interest from the tragic fate of its owner. I mean
that of the Princesse de Lamballe, who fell a victim
to her attachment to the reigning house of France
during the revolting massacres of 1792.</p>

<p>There are such things as 'joint' book-plates&mdash;book-plates
which have belonged both to husbands
and wives. We meet with some such in England,
though not at a very early date; but in Germany
they exist as far back as 1605. In England the first
example, only a printed label, is in 1737&mdash;'Mr.
Thomas and Mrs. Anne Pain.' Examples of this
dual ownership occur frequently in modern book-plates.</p>

<p>For other points of interest in and about ladies'
book-plates the reader must consult Miss Labouchere's
work; all I will do, in concluding my remarks
upon them, is to say that&mdash;as might perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
be expected&mdash;in phrases of book-possession ladies
are even more outspoken than gentlemen; few, however,
are so much so as Lady Dorothy Nevill, who
protects her books with the words 'stolen from'
placed before her name: surely she can be no more
troubled by borrowers than was the Cavalier Macciucca
(<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page_171">p. 171</a>).</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE MORE PROMINENT ENGRAVERS OF ENGLISH
BOOK-PLATES</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">William Marshall</span> heads our list of engravers
of English book-plates. We know of but one
specimen of his work, but it is exceedingly fine&mdash;the
anonymous plate of the Lyttelton family, described
on <a href="#Page_32">p. 32</a>. Marshall's works are dated between 1591
and 1646. Next after him comes the well-known
engraver of portraits, William Faithorne (b. 1633;
d. 1691), whose Portrait book-plate of Bishop Hacket
is figured opposite. David Loggan, the engraver of
the Isham book-plates in 1676, is the artist next on
our roll. How many book-plates he designed and
engraved I do not know, but there are two or three
early English examples which, in their arrangement
and touch, resemble somewhat closely his work for
Isham.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 406px;"><a id="HACKET"></a>
<img src="images/i_217.jpg" width="406" height="600" alt="Hacket's" />
</div>

<p>About this same date Michael Burghers was
engraving book-plates in England; he appears to
have left Holland in 1672, and to have settled in
Oxford. The earliest book-plate of his that I have
seen is that of Thomas Gore, already described;
perhaps he found the allegory with which he embellished
it was not popular with Englishmen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a><br /><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
his other book-plates&mdash;we know of two or three&mdash;are
in the 'Simple Armorial' style usual in English book-plates
of the period. Lord De Tabley suggests that
Christopher Sartorius, who worked at Nuremberg
between 1674 and 1737, may be connected with the
James Sartor who signed a fine English 'Jacobean'
book-plate at the opening of the eighteenth century;
of this James we know nothing except this piece of
work, which is certainly good. After Sartor comes
John Pine, whose pompous book-plate, engraved
about the year 1736, to commemorate George <span class='small'>I.</span>'s gift
of books to the University of Cambridge, has been described
and figured (<a href="#Page_75">p. 75</a>). He was born in 1690, and
died in 1756. His engravings of the Tapestry in the
House of Commons became so popular, that he was
the subject of a special Act of Parliament securing
to him the emoluments arising from the sale of the
work. Pine, as we have seen, engraved other book-plates
later on in the century.</p>

<p>Michael Vandergucht, the famous Antwerp engraver,
was also working in England before the close
of the seventeenth century, but his first book-plate is
dated in 1716. This was engraved for Sir William
Fleming, of Rydal, and is in many respects a striking
piece of work. The style is quite English of the
period: heavy mantling descends to the base of the
shield; but the inscription&mdash;'The Paternal Arms of
Sir William Fleming of Rydal in the county of
Westmoreland, Baronet,' with a description of the
heraldry&mdash;savours much of being the work of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
foreigner. It should be mentioned of this artist
that he was pupil of one of the many Boutats
who were active as engravers of foreign book-plates.
He (Vandergucht) died in Bloomsbury in
1725.</p>

<p>After him we may appropriately mention his principal
pupil&mdash;George Vertue. His most conspicuous
book-plate is certainly that of Lady Oxford, which
is already familiar to the reader.</p>

<p>Simon Gribelin is well known as a book-illustrator,
and finds frequent mention by Walpole. He was
born at Blois in 1661, came to England when nineteen,
and worked here till his death in 1733. Perhaps
the earliest book-plate he engraved is that of Sir
Philip Sydenham, which shows us the shield and
crest encircled with snakes and other ornaments,&mdash;a
book-plate decidedly foreign in appearance, though
Gribelin must have been nearly twenty years in
England when it was engraved. He did two other
book-plates for Sir Philip. He also engraved some
of the Parochial Library plates described later on
(<a href="#Page_225">pp. 225-227</a>), and some others.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 328px;"><a id="MUSGRAVE"></a>
<img src="images/i_221.jpg" width="328" height="400" alt="Musgrave's" />
</div>

<p>Though 'J. Skinner'<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> (see <a href="#Page_81">pp. 81-86</a>), an engraver
who worked at Bath, does not find mention in any
dictionary of engravers, yet he deserves notice from
the student of book-plates for the great quantity of his
work in that field&mdash;nearly all dated, and some really
very excellent. Of Skinner, Lord De Tabley writes:&mdash;'I
would gladly learn some biographical details'; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
he failed to find any, and I have been equally unfortunate.
At the British Museum there is no Bath
newspaper or directory sufficiently early to contain
either an advertisement by Skinner or a mention of
his place of residence; in the <i>Bath Directory</i> of 1812
the name is represented by two grocers, a publican,
a gardener, and one private resident&mdash;a Miss Skinner
who lived at 3 St. James's Parade. Sir Wollaston
Franks tells me that, amongst the engravers who
vouched for the perfection of <i>Sympson's New Book of
Cypher</i>&mdash;'the most perfect and neatest drawn of any
performance of the kind hitherto extant'&mdash;was one
Jacob Skinner, and it is very likely this was our
friend the engraver of book-plates, who laboured at
Bath from 1739 to 1753. He worked in three successive
styles of English book-plate engraving&mdash;the
Armorial, the Jacobean, and the Chippendale; a
fact which renders his plates of special interest to
collectors, since it enables them to see how the same
hand treats the succeeding styles when fully developed,
and during their gradual change from one style into
the other. His earliest dated book-plate that we know
is that for the library of Sir Christopher Musgrave
(figured opposite), and the next, five years later, that
of 'John Conyers of Walthamstow in Essex, Esq.'
Here the ornamentation is quite Jacobean; the
shield is oval, with wing-like excrescences at the
top and on either side&mdash;that at the top forming a
background to the helmet which supports the crest.
Next year (1738) Skinner produced the book-plate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a><br /><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of 'Francis Carington, Esq., of Wotton, Warwickshire'&mdash;in
appearance even earlier than that of
Musgrave. Some of this early appearance is perhaps
due to an absence of indication of the tinctures on
the shield&mdash;a habit which, as we shall presently see,
Skinner followed in one or two other instances. A
slight mantling falls from an esquire's helmet and
descends a little way down the shield till it joins the
Jacobean scroll-work, and the owner's name and
description are upon a fringed cloth. But the feature
to note in this book-plate is the monogrammatic
form of the engraver's signature: '<img src="images/i_222.jpg" width="21" height="25" alt="JS symbol" />.' It is the first
time he uses it, and in his subsequent dated work
he appears always to have adopted some similar
form, this being the most frequent:&mdash;'<img src="images/i_222.jpg" width="21" height="25" alt="JS symbol" />.kin<sup>r</sup>.'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 368px;"><a id="CARINGTON"></a>
<img src="images/i_223.jpg" width="368" height="450" alt="Francis Carington's" />
</div>

<p>I have spoken of J. Skinner as a Bath engraver,
but the reader will observe that none of the book-owners,
whose book-plates by him I have as yet
named, are specially connected with Bath, and on
none has the engraver mentioned it as his place of
residence; but insomuch as then&mdash;in the palmy days
of the reign of King Nash&mdash;all roads led to Bath,
it is probable that, at the fashionable season, the
Cumberland baronet, as well as the Essex and
Warwickshire squires, found his way thither, and
followed the fashion by having a book-plate engraved,
just as he would follow it, during his sojourn in
the ancient city, by squandering his time and
injuring his digestion with late hours and a surfeit
of generally unwholesome gaiety. The next dated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a><br /><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
book-plate by Skinner bears this out; on this,
engraved in 1739, he gives Bath as his place of
abode; but this book-plate is that of Francis Massy
of Rixton, Lancashire; it is similar in design to the
Carington just mentioned and figured.</p>

<p>But earlier in style than any of Skinner's work yet
mentioned is the book-plate of 'William Hillary,
M.D.,' dated in 1743; here the mantling descends
nearly to the base of the shield, quite in the
'Armorial' style. This seems to be his latest work
in early fashion. In 1741 he had designed a book-plate
for 'John William Fuhr,' in which there are
clear indications of Chippendale ornamentation.
This is indeed a transitional book-plate; it has a
Jacobean shield, which the artist has adorned with
Chippendale ornament; the tinctures are only partially
expressed and the shield remains symmetrical,
though the floral sprays and shell-work give it, at
first sight, the appearance of not being so. Identical,
almost, with this book-plate is that done by Skinner
for 'Henry Pennant,' and dated in 1742; and like it,
but weaker, is that of 'Tho<sup>s.</sup> Haviland, Bath,' dated
in the same year.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 349px;"><a id="ADAMSON"></a>
<img src="images/i_225.jpg" width="349" height="400" alt="Benjamin Adamson's" />
</div>

<p>Skinner's next book-plates are those of 'Charles
Delafaye, Esq., of Wichbury, Wilts' (1743); 'Johnson
Robinson' (1744); 'John Hughes of Brecon, Esq<sup>re.</sup>';
and 'Benja: Adamson' (1745); 'Hen. Toye Bridgeman,
Esq., of Princknash, Gloucestershire' (1746);
'Henry Walters, Esq.,' and 'John Wodroofe' (1747),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a><br /><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>and 'Tho<sup>s.</sup> Fitzherbert, Esq.,' (1749). All these last-named
book-plates are much on a level as regards
artistic merit, and that level is not a high one;
Benjamin Adamson's book-plate, figured on <a href="#Page_209">p. 209</a>,
is a fair example of it, though it is not so good as
the Bridgeman book-plate of the same year. In
1750, however, we find a more noteworthy specimen
of Skinner's work in the book-plate of 'Francis
Fleming.' There is a Scotch look about this, which
suggests that the owner, and not the engraver, was
responsible for its design; the shield is oddly shaped
and is on a medallion, whilst musical instruments
of various kinds are figured beneath; Sir Wollaston
Franks points out to me that the Fleming coat of
arms here represented is borne only by the family
of the Earls of Wigtown. The same year (1750)
Skinner did an ordinary Chippendale book-plate for
Dr. Robert Gusthart, whose name appears in the
<i>Bath Guide</i> as a doctor in practice there in 1773.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 385px;"><a id="DR_OLIVER"></a>
<img src="images/i_227.jpg" width="385" height="500" alt="Dr. Oliver's bookplate" />
</div>
<p>In 1751 Skinner engraved a pleasing Chippendale
book-plate for William Oliver, a son of his more
famous namesake, whose book-plate, also by Skinner,
has been already described in these pages (<a href="#Page_85">p. 85</a>).
Young Oliver's plate shows a remarkable fineness
of touch, and is altogether in very good taste&mdash;not
over-ornamented. Two years later we have the
latest known example of Skinner's work: the book-plate
of 'The Rev<sup>d</sup> I. Dobson, A.M.,' which is coarse
in execution, and suggests that the artist's skill as an
engraver was diminishing.</p>



<p>Of the twenty-two known book-plates by Skinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a><br /><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
only two are undated, Dr. Oliver's, already described
(<a href="#Page_85">p. 85</a>), and that of Sir John Smyth, Bart., LL.D.
This last he must have executed early in his career.
The shield bearing the arms stands upon a platform,
and is Jacobean in shape and ornamentation; the
background is shaded. Clumsily drawn and clumsily
posed female figures, partly draped, stand upon
bracket-like excrescences that spring from the shield,
whilst cupids recline below it and hold it aloft.</p>

<p>What happened to Skinner after 1753 I have
failed to discover. He is certainly an interesting
person from a book-plate collector's point of view,
and it is to be hoped something more about him
may some day be brought to light. In considering
his identity it is worth remembering that a
little after his disappearance, viz. in 1755, another
West of England engraver named Skinner&mdash;Matthew
Skinner of Exeter, is found working on book-plates.
He signs three examples, all designed in the
Chippendale style&mdash;'Jean Eli Jaqu&eacute;ri de Moudon
en Suisse, N&eacute; en 1732'; 'S<sup>r</sup> Edm<sup>d</sup> Thomas, Bart.,'
and 'Peregrine Fra<sup>s</sup> Thorne.' The two first are
ordinary Chippendale examples, but in the third
many implements of the soldier's art are introduced.</p>

<p>Another very prolific engraver of book-plates&mdash;unknown
except in that capacity&mdash;was 'Robert
Mountaine.' His book-plates are frequently dated,
but the dates are placed in the most obscure positions,
and in the smallest of figures, so it needs a
careful study of the engravings to discover them. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
laboured wholly in the Chippendale style; his touch
is peculiar, and his treatment graceful. Roughly
speaking, he worked from 1740 to 1755. His signature
varies&mdash;sometimes it is 'R.M.,' sometimes 'Mountaine.'</p>

<p>The following are a few of his book-plates:&mdash;</p>

<p>A list of nearly sixty book-plates by Mountaine is
given in the <i>Ex Libris Journal</i>, ii. p. 46.</p>

<p>Hogarth's book-plates have been already described
in this volume. The 'W. H.' who signs certain
examples, once wrongly ascribed to Hogarth, was
a certain William Hibbart, who, like Skinner, was a
Bath artist, and etched portraits after the manner of
Worlidge. Lord De Tabley mentions that Worlidge
himself executed a book-plate&mdash;that of the Honourable
Henrietta Knight&mdash;which he signs in full.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Worlidge was certainly a distinguished engraver; his
etchings after Rembrandt are excellent and highly
prized. He died in 1766.</p>

<p>The work of Sir Robert Strange as a book-plate
engraver has been already referred to. Both
Lumisden's and Dr. Drummond's book-plates were
probably executed after Strange's departure from
England, and therefore after 1745. His continental
visit was rendered necessary, or at least expedient,
by the manner in which he had identified himself
with the Stuart cause during the then recent troubles.
He had joined the Jacobite Life-Guards, and employed
his artistic ability in designing pay-notes for
the Jacobite soldiers. After studying some time in
Paris under Le Bas, he returned to England, where
he remained till 1760. He then went back to the
Continent, where his ability was freely appreciated, and
where he was loaded with decorations at Rome and
Florence. England at length recognised his merit,
and in 1787 the King conferred upon him a knighthood,
which he lived for five years to enjoy. His
devotion to the House of Stuart never altered; the
inscription beneath one of his most celebrated portraits
reads 'Charles James Edward Stuart, <i>called</i> the
Young Pretender.'</p>

<p>After the days of Strange, an innumerable number
of artists sign their names to English book-plates;
yet, with three exceptions, the names of none are
known to fame till we come to those of a comparatively
recent date. The exceptions are Francis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Bartolozzi, John Keys Sherwin, and Thomas Bewick.
Bartolozzi, the man of whom Sir Robert Strange
displayed such ill-concealed jealousy, began to work
in England about four years after the accession of
George <span class='small'>III.</span>, though it was some years before his
worth was appreciated by the people with whom he
came to reside. None of his book-plates belong to
a date prior to 1770 or 1780. He removed to
Lisbon in 1802 to take charge of the National
Academy, and while there, it will be remembered,
engraved an Englishman's book-plate in 1805 (see
<a href="#Page_95">p. 95</a>). His death took place at Lisbon in 1815.
Sherwin was born in poverty, and, owing largely
to his own folly, died in it, after having at one time
amassed a considerable sum of money. He was
a pupil of Bartolozzi, gained the Royal Academy
gold medal in 1772, and was appointed Engraver to
the King in or about 1785. His book-plate work
is referred to at <a href="#Page_72">p. 72</a>.</p>

<p>Thomas Bewick, who, as we have seen (<a href="#Page_108">pp. 108-13</a>),
was the most prolific of any English engraver of
book-plates, was born at Cherry Burn, in Northumberland,
in 1753, and died in 1828. The incidents in
his history are too well known to need repetition
here, and his work upon book-plates has been already
mentioned. It may be, however, noticed that his
earliest book-plate is dated in 1797, the year in which
he published the first volume of his <i>British Birds</i>.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ODDS AND ENDS</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 466px;">&nbsp;<a id="PEPYS"></a>
<img src="images/i_233.jpg" width="466" height="650" alt="Pepys'" />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>ODDS and ends! The compiler of a volume of
this sort is sure to find plenty of these,&mdash;scraps worth
putting in somewhere, yet not coming precisely under
any particular head. In the first place, 'Portrait'
book-plates claim attention. We have seen that they
exist, but, alas! that they are so few; for, to any
reasonable person, members of the Heralds' College,
of course, excepted, a man's features are certainly
more interesting than his armorial bearings. In
England, Sam. Pepys adopted the style, which was
not then unknown on the Continent. Pirckheimer
perhaps originated it, by placing, as I have already
said, a portrait of himself at the end of the volumes,
which contained his now familiar book-plate by
D&uuml;rer on the front cover; and there are many other
early foreign examples. One of the most conspicuous
is the bust-portrait of John Vennitzer, of Nuremberg,
engraved by Pfann, and dated in 1618, to which
I have already alluded (<a href="#Page_140">p. 140</a>). Pepys used to place
the small variety of his portrait book-plate&mdash;that
figured opposite&mdash;at the commencement of many of
his books, and that showing his interwoven initials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a><br /><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
('the little plate for my books') at the end. Both his
portrait book-plates are by White. I have failed
to find any allusion in his <i>Diary</i> to the engraving
of these book-plates, though, as we have seen, he
refers to the preparation of another (see <a href="#Page_8">p. 8</a>). He
very likely took the idea of a 'Portrait' book-plate
from that which Faithorne, either in or soon after
1670, prepared to place in the volumes left by good
Bishop Hacket to Cambridge (see <a href="#Page_201">p. 201</a>).</div>


<p>It is possible that we have a portrait in the figure
on the book-plate, already noticed, of Louis Bosch,
a clergyman of Tamise, near Antwerp; but the head
is too small to afford an interesting likeness. The
priest sits at a table in his study, the walls of which
are lined with volumes, and beneath him is written
in Latin: 'A hunt in such a forest never wearies,'&mdash;the
'forest being,' as Lord De Tabley observes, 'the
rows and ranks of his reverence's books.' In France
the 'Portrait' book-plate is not uncommon; that of a
French clergyman, Francis Perrault, figured opposite,
is a nice piece of work, and bears the date 1764; but
portraits, possibly or indeed probably, of the owners
occur on French book-plates at an earlier date. In
Italy there is an example in 1760, the book-plate
of Filippo Linarti.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 413px;"><a id="PERRAULT"></a>
<img src="images/i_235.jpg" width="413" height="650" alt="Perrault's portrait" />
</div>


<p>An instance of the use of the 'Portrait' book-plate
in England during the last century is afforded by that
of 'Jacobus Gibbs, Architectus, 1736,' which is found
in the architectural books bequeathed by the possessor
to the Radcliffe Library at Oxford, a building which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a><br /><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
he designed. James Gibbs was born at Aberdeen in
1674, but came south early in his career, and Londoners
may see examples of his work in the churches of St.
Martin-in-the-Fields and St. Mary le Strand. He
also built the Senate House at Cambridge. He died
in 1754. On his book-plate, which is oblong in shape
and might well form the head-piece to a preface,
the portrait appears in a medallion, surrounded by
shell and scroll-work. The engraver, who signs his
initials B. B., was Bernard Baron, a Frenchman, who
came to England in 1736 and engraved Hogarth's
portrait of Gibbs.</p>

<p>The resuscitator of 'Portrait' book-plates in England
in recent times was the late Mr. Thoms. That
veteran antiquary tells, in a letter to the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>,
how he came to use, as a book-plate, a photograph
of himself taken by Dr. Diamond in the very early
days of photography. Beneath this he placed an
inscription setting forth that the volume in which it
was fastened was for the use of himself and his
friends&mdash;a repetition of the sentiment on one of the
Pirckheimer book-plates, 'Sibi et amicis.' We do
not, of course, know how far Pirckheimer meant
what he said; but we do know, any of us who ever
asked the loan of a volume from Mr. Thoms, that the
sentiment was by him really meant. No worthy
book-borrower ever met with refusal from that ever
courteous literary enthusiast.</p>

<p>After considering 'Portrait' book-plates, the collector
may turn his attention to the study of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
book-plates that have belonged to interesting men.
I have spoken of many of these in reaching this
point in my volume, but to the names already
mentioned may be added some more: Charles, Earl
of Dorset and Middlesex, who, as Lord Buckhurst,
was a prominent figure at the dull court of Dutch
William, saved Dryden from ruin and introduced
Mat Prior to society. Then there is Robert Harley&mdash;great
minister, great statesman, and underminer of
the Whig power; founder of the collection of books
and manuscripts which now bears his name. The inscription
on his book-plate reads: 'Robert Harley of
Brampton Castle in the county of Hereford, Esq<sup>re</sup>';
it is found in two sizes&mdash;one for folio volumes, and
another for those of smaller size. Its date may be
fixed at the very close of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Then we have the book-plate of Sir Thomas
Hanmer, the Speaker, a bold piece of work, in the
'Simple Armorial' style, dated 1707. Hanmer was
born in 1676, so that his book-plate was executed
when he was in his thirty-first year&mdash;that is, six years
prior to his first entry of the House of Commons,
and probably before he had made much use of
the library with which his name was afterwards
associated, when towards the close of his life he
ceased to be a man of politics and became a man
of letters. He died in 1746, leaving, completed,
his edition of Shakespeare's works in half a dozen
volumes.</p>

<p>With the book-plate of Sir Thomas Hanmer we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
may, appropriately, consider that of Sir Paul
Methuen, the soldier and minister of Anne and
George <span class='small'>I.</span>, with whom Hanmer must have been
frequently brought in contact. Methuen's book-plate
is altogether more exceptional in style than
Hanmer's; the mantling, after being blown about
by a strong wind, ends regularly in tassels; curious
creatures figure in the design, and the bracket, on
which rests the shield, is upheld by a male and a
female angel.</p>

<p>Methuen's book-plate was engraved about 1720.
Five years later we find that of John, Lord Boyle,
who, though by means of the quarrel with his father
he was robbed of the Boyle library, had, whilst yet
a young man, a sufficient stock of volumes of his
own to necessitate the use of a distinguishing mark
for them. His book-plate is by John Hulett, an
indifferent engraver.</p>

<p>Matthew Prior's book-plate now claims attention;
indeed, if these book-plates of celebrities were taken
in strictly chronological order, it should have been
considered before that of Sir Paul Methuen. In style
it is early Jacobean, so that we may date it at, say,
1718, though there is nothing in the inscription&mdash;'Matthew
Prior, Esq.'&mdash;to show to what particular
period in the 'thin hollow-looked' man's life it
belongs. But it is tempting to place it at the
close of his career as a diplomatist, when he was
settling down on the small country property that
Harley had bought for him, and was rich on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
proceeds of the subscription to his huge volume of
<i>Occasional Poems</i>.</p>

<p>After Prior's book-plate we do not meet with
another of a celebrity for a considerable number
of years. One appears at last in that engraved&mdash;probably
by a Scotch engraver, about the year 1740&mdash;for
the luckless Lord Lovat, who lost his head on
Tower Hill after the second Scotch rebellion. The
inscription deserves consideration, because it is characteristic
of the man: 'The Right Honourable Simon
Lord Fraser of Lovat, Chief of the Ancient Clan of
the Frasers, Governor of Inverness,' etc. Mark the
way in which he emphasises his headship of the
clan! Can he, in those early days, have heard
whisperings of a story that he had an elder brother
who was in hiding lest the law should mete out
to him its penalty for murder? Anyhow, it is a
fine bold book-plate, more in the style of English
book-plates of a dozen years earlier; a heavy ermine-lined
mantle of estate falls from the back of the
helmet and encloses both shield and supporters.</p>

<p>John Wilkes had three book-plates, and what is
remarkable, they all make display of the Wilkes
armorial bearings. One would fancy that the great
demagogue would, at least in the decoration of the
shield, display bombs, kegs of gunpowder, Phrygian
caps, or other emblems of the manifestation and
enjoyment of liberty; but it is not so. Lawrence
Sterne's book-plate is certainly more appropriate.
Here we have the bust of a young man, whom Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
de Tabley considers to be either Juvenal or Martial,
placed on a slab, on either side of which are closed
volumes, one inscribed, 'Alas! poor Yorick,' and the
other, 'Tristram Shandy.' No doubt this book-plate
was engraved in or about the year 1761, when Sterne
had bought&mdash;as he told a correspondent&mdash;seven hundred
books, 'dog cheap, and many good,' which he
was then busy arranging in the 'best room at Coxwould.'
Samuel Rogers's book-plate is in the 'wreath
and ribbon' style. William Cowper's is a little later,
and shows us a plain shield without the festoon-decoration.
His must become a scarce book-plate,
for he had but few books&mdash;only 177 at his death, and
the book-plate does not appear in all; perhaps he
began to insert it, but was stopped by loss of reason.
Mr. Bolton suggests that the book-plate may be the
work of Thomas Park, an engraver who, he reminds
us, offered to do anything for Cowper in the way of
his art as a labour of love, so much did he appreciate
the poet's writings. Byron's book-plate, alluded
to elsewhere, is without one remarkable feature;
whether or not it is that sent him by the fair admirer
already referred to (<a href="#Page_16">p. 16</a>) one cannot say. Thomas
Carlyle's book-plate was engraved, in 1853, by H. P.
Walker.</p>

<p>One might extend a list of celebrities who have
used book-plates <i>ad infinitum;</i> but there is no
need to attempt that process here, though it might
be as well to point out that certain book-plates,
inscribed with the names of celebrities, which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
induced collectors to speak of them as the book-plates
of these distinguished persons, cannot really have
been made for them. There is, for instance, an early
Chippendale book-plate inscribed 'William Wilberforce,'
which is, or perhaps I should say, used to be,
constantly spoken of as the book-plate of the famous
man who was bold enough to suggest that England's
colonies could get on very well without the presence
of slavery. Now this book-plate is very little, if any,
later than 1750, and the great emancipator was not
born till 1759; as a matter of fact it was probably
engraved for his grandfather, William Wilberforce
of Hull. A great many specimens bear his signature
written at the top of the book-plate. Then,
to give one more instance, there is the book-plate
inscribed 'Capt. Cook,' and in this you are told to
see the mark of ownership which the once popular
hero placed in the volumes that composed his library;
but, so far as the evidence of this book-plate goes,
Captain Cook may never have had a library at all.
It bears arms highly appropriate to a navigator; but
they were not granted to the Cook family till 1785,
and, as every reader of travel knows, Captain Cook was
murdered in 1779. In all probability this book-plate
was engraved for the navigator's son, James Cook,
who, in 1793, attained to the rank of commander in
the Navy; 1793, be it said, is&mdash;to judge from its style
and decoration&mdash;about the date of the book-plate.</p>

<p>Book-plates of English parish libraries and institutions
deserve some notice for several reasons. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
these days, when enthusiasm for the erection of free
libraries is so great, it is curious to be reminded of
the past and long-forgotten efforts of our ancestors to
civilise their neighbours by the use of books. Gloomy
affairs most of these 'parish' libraries are now! You
still sometimes find them locked in a damp vestry, or
in a country vicarage, where their existence is a secret
to the parishioners, and, indeed, to most other people.
The book-plates of some of them are interesting.
There is a neat design in the Jacobean style, which
shows us the shield divided, and contains on the
sinister side two crossed keys, and on the dexter two
crossed swords. This is inscribed 'Swaffham Library.
T. Dalton, F. Rayner, churchwardens, 1737.' At
least two designs for these parish book-plates are
by Simon Gribelin. In one, we have St. John in the
isle of Patmos; and in the other, an unidentifiable
figure kneeling in prayer. To each the artist has
placed his initials, 'S. G.,' and both belong to about
the same date&mdash;1723.</p>

<p>A great many of these parochial libraries were
founded early in the last century by Dr. Thomas
Bray, during his lifetime, and by a body calling
themselves the 'Associates of Dr. Bray,' after his
death. It was at Bray's instance that the Act of
7 Anne, 'for the better Preservation of Parochial
Libraries,' was passed by Parliament. One of the
earliest of the foundations under it was in 1720.</p>

<p>It is probable that the 'Associates' issued book-plates
for placing in the volumes of the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
libraries established; for there is, in the design, a
space left blank for the insertion, with pen and
ink, of the name of the particular library using the
book-plate. These book-plates generally bear texts
or some appropriate words, such as, 'Accipe librum
et devora illum' (Rev. x. 9), the scene depicted being
St. John, in the isle of Patmos, receiving the book
from the angel; or sometimes a reminder to the
borrower that he needs to do more than borrow the
volume in order to profit by its contents, such as
<i>Tolle, Lege</i>, which appears on the book-plate of the
parish library of Weobley!</p>

<p>Grotesque heraldry is not often met with in England
on genuine book-plates. We have seen that
on many examples the decorative accessories of the
shield have a certain appropriateness to the owner;
besides this, the arms borne have frequently a direct
reference to the bearer's name. But grotesque
heraldry, such as that which Hogarth was so fond
of designing, is certainly rare in engravings prepared
for book-plates. There is, however, one example of
such heraldry on an English book-plate, which is
worth referring to&mdash;I mean the very interesting example
figured on <a href="#Page_229">p. 229</a>. This belonged to the shoemaker-poet,
Robert Bloomfield, and certainly the
arms upon it are both grotesque and appropriate
to the owner, since they commemorate his only
really successful literary effort, <i>The Farmer's Boy</i>.
Look for a moment at the details, for they repay
inspection. A figure on cow-back holding a shoe on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the end of a stick, does duty as a crest, two ploughmen
act as supporters, whilst the bearings on the
shield represent every variety of agricultural implement,
every occupant of a farm-yard ordinarily met
with, and various tools connected with the owner's
craft; besides, on the sinister half of the shield, is
a cobbler in an attitude suggestive of his having
done full justice to a feast in honour of St. Crispin&mdash;not
conducted on total abstinence principles. The
quarterings also include three open volumes, and
across the pages of one is printed 'Farmer's Boy.'
The whole&mdash;even to its motto, 'A fig for the Heralds'&mdash;is
most characteristic of Bloomfield, and was engraved
for him, in 1813&mdash;ten years before his death&mdash;by
a Cheapside engraver.</p>

<p>With this gathering together of scraps and clippings
I will bring my volume to a close. Most of
what I have said, and a very great deal besides, is well
known to the students of book-plates; but to them,
I fancy, this work is not intended to appeal. It is
meant for the public at large, to the majority of
whom book-plates are unconsidered trifles. To promote
wholesale book-plate <i>collecting</i> in albums and
portfolios is certainly not my intention. If it were,
it would be a very undesirable intention, for so far
as it succeeded it would unquestionably lead to the
wholesale disfigurement and destruction of books,
without regard to their value. What I have aimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a><br /><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
at is to awaken a wider interest in book-plates, and
a wider observation of them in their abiding places,
by those who either possess them already, or acquire
them hereafter. If I have succeeded in doing this,
my work will, I am vain enough to believe, be not
altogether unsuccessful; for book-plates possess really
an artistic and general interest, which will be heightened
the more our stock of knowledge concerning
them is increased.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>
